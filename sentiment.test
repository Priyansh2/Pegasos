__label__0 i have been a longtime act  user  my biggest complaint is recovery  if you have to move the email and database to another computer due to a failure you have to jump through hoops  that s just what one feels like doing when the pressure is on  i still ca nt bring my act   email over even though act  says it was restored successfully  empty folders    they have a ridiculous technical support team unwilling to help unless you pay  pay and pay and their knowledge base must have been restored like my email  nonexistent  the earlier versions were great  i agree with a previous reviewer that when they switched to sql it all went downhill  i think i ll stick with anything else  it is really ashame  act  used to be fast  tight and clean  now it is clunky  lethargic and hangs for  seconds on all the time  for some stupid reason  running on an a  dual core amd with gb memory  even when symantec had it they did nt screw it up  but now  you may be betteroff sticking with the palm pilot contact management software well  maybe not
__label__1 after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places  i ve been very  very pleased  the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky  ran on batteries  and had shutter problems but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect  so i thought i would go for the dsct  since it avoids all of those problems  only a tiny battery to charge  no sticky shutter  and it s sexy as hell  the screen is huge and very bright  i hate taking pictures with flash in general  and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera   and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything  however  you can easily change this by going into the over  under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments  they come out surprisingly well and blurfree
__label__1 there s too much drama going on in this discussion  i do nt really care about what year these episodes came out or that there are  missing episodes of the new scooby doo movies  i m just glad there s more scooby
__label__1 very easy to install  great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera  would recommend to anybody
__label__0 i have had both the s and the s i was disapointed when my s power switch stopped working after  months  but i was happy with the picture quality  i replaced it with the s  it has a slightly better feature set over the s  in particular shutter speed choices  while on a trip to niagara falls  i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt  and i mean slight  after that it would nt power up  i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable
__label__1 buy this cable through amazon and you wo nt be sorry  i looked all over the internet and its sometimes hard to find a good company online to buy through and after the manufacture was sold out these cables  a friend told me about amazon  i typed in the cable number and amazon had it in stock  i decided to order this and hope for the best well sure enough the cable arrived on time just like amazon said  i know have a great working usb cable for my digital camera  i order three since all my friends and family always ask to borrow mine and the fact that i need a replacement  if i had the money i would buy five of these  its the fact that me  my family  and friends are always misplacing are cables or losing them  so i order this cable through amazon  its nice to know if i lose my cables i can buy more  ever since i bought these cables i have been making sure i know where i put em  be happy and buy with no worries
__label__0 hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states  i have a problem with my camera and i do nt have anyone to help  i ve been trying some help in amazon s help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help  i do nt really understand why is this site so well known on  quot  customer servicequot   but i just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything  i m just mad about this  if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there s no such a thing like help in the  quot  help areaquot   i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera  it s really fragile  so if you re still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm  do nt do it  they do nt care about the customer satisfaction at all
__label__1 i bought this camera for my  year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography  it had to be easy  the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends  i have used the older cx   very similar camera  for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions  the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me  less to break  the c is more compact  has better resolution  and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die  if you want simple digital snapshots  you will love this little camera
__label__0 the noname comedians at the beginning were funny  bea arthur killed  and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how africanamericans used to dig her backside but do nt any longer was funny  courtney love s antics were amusing but grew tiresome  the rest of the roast was horrible  telling tommy lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult  and  after it s repeated ad nauseum  it s not funny either  has andy dick ever been funny  kimmel  corolla  sarah silverman  spade postfarley  no  it s as if comedy central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past  years  and the bonus features are horrible  the interviewer was annoying even the guests seemed annoyed with her  was gilbert gottfried not available  that guy is funny
__label__1 back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest newwave band in pop music by fans and critics alike  there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as  bubblegum pop   and one group that would never have staying power  but i think it s been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh  parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success  this album is also the first where debbie harry s voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet  vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next  the album made punk  pop  and disco shake hands  which was a method unheard of in  songs like  hanging on the telephone    picture this    pretty baby   and  sunday girl   have become irresitable pop gems  while  i know but i do nt know   and  fade away  radiate   featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp  are punkdriven classics  last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in  one way or another   and  heart of glass   and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years  as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked  on their list of the  greatest albums of all time   madonna was surely watching
__label__1 this cd is a confusing mix of punk bands  from poppunk s sum   amp  good charlotte to punk favorites alkaline trio  vandetta red   amp  the casualties to bands that i ve never even heard of such as unsung zeros  ozma   amp  destruction made simple  i reccomend this cd if you re looking for new bands to like  amp  listen to  although it s a confusing cd  it gives you new ideas of just how deep you re going to go in the punk underground
__label__1 these wipes are great  i have three children and have used the pampers  huggies  and housebrand wipes  the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done  housebrand do nt smell as good and tend to be a bit rough  the pampers are thin  soft  and moist enough to get the job donebecause they are thin  they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded  refolded for  useage  unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver   definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said  if you want something moister  go get a paper towel and wet it with water
__label__0 i got this telescope for my desk at work because i have a decent view  it stinks  i think i can see better with my naked eye  plus you can not focus it because the slider is so stiff  i guess i will be buying another telescope now
__label__0 perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality  my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all  i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about  times better  my recommendation is do not buy
__label__1 i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product  i have created numerous videos of my children s escapades and sporting events  i do have one warning however  provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen  the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use  my wildest expectations were exceeded
__label__0 i bought this from amazon and i do nt like it  the masured temperature drifts from f to f in  minutes  so inaccurate
__label__0 no moving parts contrary to depiction above  the  attachments  are tiny plastic   knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet  they do not move  there is no massaging action  you do all the work  making your hips and knees sore  the  massaging foot beds  are totally motionless and form a spiky  painful surface  vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device  jets are totally underpowered  no fill line indicator so  bubbles  spill water onto floor  heater is completely useless  after  minutes water temp was no different  cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads  classic deception in advertising
__label__1 i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did  this one gives me a really good shave  i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since  another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud  which it is but since you turn it on and leave it  i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem
__label__1 i loved the first one and i think  with the logic and plot of the first one  this follows through  we knew they changed the world  and in this sequel we see that  the actors do a good  since the lead characters are suppose to be  let s say less intelligent  but nice  i think this movie and the st one are classics  i like the grim reaper  his atitude during the movie  and the fact the he is the comic relief  okay so most of the movie is comic relief  even if they are fun to watch to laugh at  it is worth it to watch
__label__0 i am wondering when this plague will be over  and when we ll be set free to listen to real music  we all are so tired of her
__label__1 i bought this as a present for my wife  i was looking for something that she could carry in her purse  the automatic functions are easy and functional  it is not an enthusiasts camera  too hard to get into the menus  the screen is easy to turn off  this sucks battery power   and it even has an optical viewfinder  a rare finding lately  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes  the pictures are clear and the colors are excellent  the drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg  the wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary  read that as expensive if you lose it
__label__1 wowokay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size  this is about half the size of an ipod mini  it is by no means big  read the dimesions well before you purchase  the photos are really good quality and clear just small lol
__label__0 while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot midsummer weather  we ended up renting  analyze that  and boy  what a mistake that was  we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to  s  analyze this   the potential was there  it s not as if writers  of course it s never a good sign to see numerous writers  peter tolan  peter steinfeld  and harold ramis did nt have decent material to work with  robert deniro  billy crystal  lisa kudrow  and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy  however  this being hollywood and all  another sequel was botched  it s because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation  despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some  fish out of water  situations  the movie seemed to go downhill soon after  the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an overthetop heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as  crossroads   now either they ran out of jokes  they did nt have enough time to invest in an actual story  or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already   the sopranos    the whole  yards    mickey blue eyes   etc etc   that there was simply nothing left to write about
__label__1 well its definetly improved version since the last one  but they still have a lot of things to do  the biggest problem is pages  if text has specific symbols  like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc  forget it  u ll have the same problem as  yrs ago  either funky symbols or underline dashes  keynote is much better  but if u r a scientist and not a sales man  both packages still have a lot of room for improvement  however  i m still happy with this purchase  because it s apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future
__label__1 not too hard and not too soft  camera fits nicely  with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera
__label__1 at the elementary school my children attend they have it on their computers  so they were begging me to buy it for them  its very user friendly  even my  year old can play with it without assistance
__label__0 this was ok nothing more nothing less  this album was hard to review  beacuse no songs really stick out  i mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes  laced over just above mediocre beats  i have heard better sesame street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van  i mean what does the album have that sticks out   saturday to saturday    bloody horseshoe   or the multi  faceted  boo  we ai nt forgot about you  none of the above  or none on the album  sorry  and please  all angry people who think that this is a bad review  remember  it s a review  i can say what i want
__label__0 you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fapp lumix camera  the camera does not come close to fitting in this case  the camera is     inches wider than the case
__label__0 i give it  stars for porn and  stars for a movie  therefore  collectively  you have your single star  by all means  i suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn  beat off  and then watch a real movie  caligula blows literally and royally  it is a little under  hours  which seemed like  days  and there is only about  minutes of decent film  the small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn  the most triumphant scene in the movie is where the roman soldiers attack the phallushumbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro  this movie is ridiculous  in order to enjoy this  one must be completely perverted and dimwitted
__label__0 reba is not country anymore period   this cd will prove that  just listen to the first track which i think is horrible  as a matter of fact i think the whole cd is horrible  not deserving of reba s talent
__label__0 if there s a worse movie than this i have nt seen it  looks like it was made in a day  the quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits  sort of like it was copied from a vhs tape that was recorded in the  hour mode after it was played    times  the actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad twilight zone episode  if you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes  the musical performances are obscure little known doo wop flops   except for frankie lymon   looki wasted  plus tax plus gas to  run out  and buy this bomb  the only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in swedish  send it to a greenwich village  art house  and pass it off as a foreign film  come to think of itdo nt bother to dub itthe sound is so off it looks dubbed already  important updateplease read this  i later discovered after i wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the s  i understand that it is used constantly at the international institute for sleep disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semicomcious near sleep state for incurable insomniacs  and so as i write this update i ve been watching the flick again and i must admiti   yawn  oh excuse mewhere was ioh yes i must admit that i   bigger yawn  oh my goodnessi m so sorrythis is so rude of me   yawn  but it seems like   snoring  i   snoring  i just ca nt seem to  intense snoring
__label__1 this is the stuff that rap dreams are made of  just like the movie itself  this cd is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy  the talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so  get in  sit down  buckle up and shut the fk up because it s about to get rowdy up in here
__label__0 i found stale recounting of very wellknown facts about th century technologies and their economics  with no insights  since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors  and it s only  pages in a fairly large typeface  i was nt expecting historical depth  but i was expecting at least one fresh idea  i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg  about technology in the economy of the th century   i was disappointed  i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower   college freshmen born in the s  i ll bet they find it kinda stodgy
__label__1 i purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal  nonbusiness  matter  so the noncommercial license was fine for my  home  use  good thing i checked with corel after buying it and seeing the  home edition  captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the  wordperfect  and  quattro pro  components  inside front box folding cover with velcro   corel ultimately confirmed to me that  certain components that are designed for the business customer  such as legal tools  metadata removal  document compare  quickfinder to name a few are not included in the home edition version   corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the  home edition   i focused on the word processing application  but the quattro pro application is also captioned as  home edition  so it may be missing some features available in the quattro pro included in other suite versions  standard  pro  student  teacher  etc   the home edition may still be suitable for some users  but i m a strong believer in  full disclosure   wordperfect itself is a great program  try setting point sizes with decimals in word   you cant  try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in word   there s no direct control of it  the microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get word to adjust the font size  but remember  you need any wordperfect version other than home edition to get legal tools
__label__0 my one star rating is for amazon s service  not the waterpik attachment  which i never received  despite the fact that i ordered this on  february  and shipping was stated to be  days  and is still stated to be  days   two weeks later amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until  april  i have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days  in my many years ordering from amazon  i have found it s best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay  as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised  i do nt understand why amazon ca nt keep better track of their inventory

__label__0 i found these diapers while searching for the th generation brand diapers  i was impressed and eager to try tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them  i ordered the medium size for my lb baby  the diapers came sooner then expected  which was great  my single star rating comes from my experience using them  they have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit  it seems like no matter how tight i can get the diapers my son leaks through them  out the sides and up the belly  because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash  his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week
__label__0 i agree with reviewer mr dietz  i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for  put it in and loaded it in  this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all  no help menu either  we wasted at least  hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her  there is nothing here to learn chess from
__label__1 very happy with this purchase  received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an  credit card  it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors  i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily  good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently  also  the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
__label__0 used it once and put it in the dogs  tub  it s really awkward to use  it sucks up your water pressure  too  ca nt figure it out  i have incredible water pressure  but with this thing on  it went down to nothing  stick to the original shower massage by waterpik
__label__1 if you have used ms streets  trips  then you ll know your way around autoroute  we are using this to plan a trip to europe next may  based on my knowledge of locations in britian  the software appears to be pretty accurate  if you want to use this with a gps that does not come bundled with the package  expect some frustration  i still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my usb based garmin unit  i think it is possible  just do not know how
__label__0 i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders  i did go to the nuance website before ordering  they did nt have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard  anyway  if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing  you need the preferred version  not this one
__label__1 the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood eric fleming was mindblowing one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of himtodays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great westernyes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood
__label__1 i ve used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far kodaks treated me the best  if your out to capture rich  vibrant colors this is the film for you  so far i ve shot  rolls of it and i m amazed at how much the colors stand out  its definatly the film i ll be using
__label__0 the adjustable slider combs are horrible and i found the conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me  i cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short  it would not even take any hair off  all it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery  i thought this was the best brand out there  but conair beats them by a mile  i think i will take it back and get a refund and go buy a conair with the money
__label__0 i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers  after using about  times it stopped working  i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable  the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint  i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer  a little more money but worth the price in the long run
__label__1 for over three years i ve been studying buddhism and zen  during that time i ve ordered many books within the different buddhist schools  there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen  i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha s message to mankind  however  the true  nuts and bolts  of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen  it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it  ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one s life where we need it the most  during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain  core pain is comprised of our anger  traumas  sadness  feelings of inferiority  etc it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell  ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works  instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life  and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve  at least one reader has referred to this as being like a selfhelp book  yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology  are nt we looking for something to help us  ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life  when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life  what i did nt realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book  psychology book  or college text  another reviewer said  where s the zen  in reference to the contents of this book   the zen  is there on every page  while ezra does nt use the esoteric style of writing common in zen  buddhist teaching  his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about  ezra s other two books  at home in the muddy water  and  saying yes to life  are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment  a helpful hint  read his three books in chronological order with this book first  personally  i think that reading them in order adds to a person s understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next  ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings  i bow to you for you are a master  there are many of us i m sure that are looking forward to your future works  two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are  beginning mindfulness  learning the way of awareness  by andrew weiss and  at hell s gate  a soldier s journey  by claude anshin thomas  also  the writing s of thich nhat hanh  a great man who highly influenced both of these authors  teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner  good luck to you on the path
__label__0 my hunting buddy purchased a nikon  my intent was to put him in the shade  that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro  tried new batteries  tried bluffing  even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past    yards  my opinion is this product is not worth the postage  anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product
__label__0 someone named  ndb   and i m willing to bet a princely sum of money that he goes by  ndboston  in certain other online venuesahem  hit it right on the head  there is no curse  there never was  glad that the phantasm of a curse managed to put dan shaughnessy s kids through college ok  but the red sox have had damned good reasons why they ve lost over the years  and none of them has to do with ghosts  specters  curses or other figments of the imagination  none of which takes away from the unbridled joy that we all feel in red sox nation at this wonderful  beautiful championship   by the way  ndb  shank is still gonna prime that pump  check this site for enthralling details of the windytitled  legend of the curse of the bambino   due to hit stores in may  and deepdiscount racks in july or august at the latest
__label__1 for years i used powerquest s drive image  for backups  it s rock solid and totally dependable  when symantec aquired powerquest they rolled the underlying technology of drive image  into norton ghost  the result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups  most importantly  like drive image   it provides for emergency recovery of your system  just boot from the ghost cd and restore the backup  restore point  that you select  i ve tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups  and then restoring the system from those backups  the process works flawlessly  if you need to restore to a different physical drive  replaced a failed drive  etc   the process requires a few extra selections  but is still very straightforward  just take the time to read the manual  i ve seen acronis true image recommended by some both here and elsewhere  i ve tried acronis and find it lacking in one major respect  it simply is not reliable  during trials  i made backups with acronis  acronis indicated that the backups were successful but  when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later  acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used  the backups were worthless  when purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles do nt count for anything  the only thing that counts is reliability  it must be able to reliably restore your system  norton ghost passes that test with flying colors
__label__0 i had not realized what great performers michael flatley  colin dunne and jean butler were until i watched this version of riverdance  the lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions  what made riverdance great for me was the precision  timing  and dancers dancing togeather in the irish dance numbers  it is all gone here  try  riverdance  live from new york city  or the video tape  riverdance  the show  instead  this version should not have been released
__label__1 i read the hundred penny box when i was in third grade  years ago  its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever  i have created my own hundred penny box and just made one for a friend s newborn son  my grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers  an illness i assume that greatgreataunt dew suffered from  i took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over easter  we read it together and discussed his own memories over the years  while his memory is fading  i felt it important to hear them myself  love them  and save them in my own memory as michael did for aunt dew  i would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good  heartwarming story
__label__1 i did enjoy this book as it was my first introduction to magnet therapy  this is a topic that i intend to explore much further too  it was very helpful and gave good information
__label__0 i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it  the price was right but the quality was poor and there were  spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out  displaying blue and green pixels   i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all  overall do nt waste your time and money
__label__0 statutory rape is not funny  neither is bad acting or pretentious scripts   well  okay they are but unintentionally   would have been sexy and funny if  oscar was  oscar was not a pretentious ass  oscar s stepmom was lena olin  and oscar was played by topher grace  gawd  why ca nt i get paid to churn out mindless crap like this    yes  i could do this movie better  i would dump the steady cam  for starters  aaah  end pretentious crap movies  just say no
__label__1 very entertaining movie  i enjoyed everything about this movie   the acting  the humor  the singing and storyline  also being from san diego originally  it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark  the hotel del coronado  being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed  no the hotel was nt the seminole ritz in florida
__label__0 received the item but it did nt work  nor did it have very good instructions  emailed company  times with no response

__label__1 rosetta stone spanish is the third major spanish course that i am buying  i have comtpleted all of the spanish lessons in the pimsleur series  and have also completed learning spanish like crazy level one and two  i am one of those rare latinas that did not learn spanish from my parents  my mexican parents felt that it would be easier to  assimilate  if i only spoke english  after going to my grandparents  home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak spanish  and after having latino strangers speak to me in spanish and then look at me in astonishment when i struggled just to say  no  hablo espanol   i felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language  the first course that i used was pimsleur spanish  compared to rosetta stone i must say that i learned much more vocabulary with the rosetta stone software  but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone  especially for the complete beginner  because of its easy teaching method  in my opinion pimsleur is even better than lslc for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking spanish  pimsluer goes at a very slow pace  but if you have already learned some spanish on your own or in high school or college  then you can probably skip pismleur and go straight to lslc  or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you ll probably want to go with learning spanish like crazy  lslc covers a lot more spanish words and grammar than pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace  so where does rosetta stone fit in  i would say use rosetta stone after you have completed the above courses  it is difficult to really learn how to speak spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear  you never really learn how to think in spanish and create your own sentences  so why am i still giving it  stars  because if you already know how to speak some spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more spanish words to your vocabulary by using the rosetta stone software  one negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software s interface is  antiquated  with photos from the s  and the sound quality is not as clear as pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy  but if you stick it out through the drudgery  you will be surprised with how many spanish words you learned with this software  but i think pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing  and by teaching me concepts  i have really retained the material and by understanding concepts  i am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences  something that i would not have been able to do if i had used this course alone  another negative about this course  is that unlike the other two courses that i mentioned  you have to use rosetta stone while sitting in a computer  that is difficult for me because i am very busy with classes  work and my personal life  i can use pimsleur or lslc on my mp player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer  besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method  the only downside of pimsleur is that it does not teach the same spanish words that are most commonly used by mexicans and other latinos in regular conversation  pimsleur spanish is very formal spanish  we say  mucho gusto  like lslc teaches  pimsleur teaches  encantado   and in our overly  macho  culture if a man responds with  encantado  many latinos may get the wrong impression about him  it is not something that i am proud to say about my  latino  culture  but it is true  and pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say  encantado  to some latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker  learning spanish like crazy has taught me useful practical spanish that i can use to communicate with my spanish speaking friends and family  when i tell people that i learned to speak spanish as an adult and not at home as a child  many of them do not believe me  i think they find it incredible for two reasons  one  my accent really sounds like a native speaker from using lslc  two  i have learned real conversational spanish from lslc  i have learned words and phrases that spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other  pimsleur taught me spanish that the author of the course thought that i should speak  not the spanish that latinos really speak  that is one of the positive things that separates lslc course from the others  so in what order would i rate the three in terms of ease of teaching method   pimsleur spanish  learning spanish like crazy  rosetta stone spanish but in terms of teaching real conversational spanish and teaching a real latin american accent  i rate them as follows   learning spanish like crazy  pimsleur spanish  rosetta stone spanish
__label__1 excellent product  easy to use  great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork  i ca nt wait to experiment with it
__label__0 many have seen this movie on tv many times  for a bmovie it is great fun and interesting to watch  no extras on the dvd  i wish they did add something from behind the scenes  etc
__label__0 design seems flawed a bit for the container  when you pull the cord out  it bumps the tank off sometimes  the tank also seems a little loose when mounted  i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type  but it only lasted  month then began to leak water
__label__1 i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
__label__0 this product is very nice when it works  however  i m having the same problem as the reviewer below me  when i attempt to export the image  either by saving  draging or copying  hemera places a transparency over the object  making the product worthless  i gave it two stars because  for the two months it worked  it worked well  however  now  it wo nt work at all  and as the other reviewer stated  support is nearly nonexistant
__label__0 i spent  days trying to get this installed  i think the complication was that i had norton systemworks  and wanted to add the nav  on top of it  well i finally got it done  but not until i d restored my system to a backup from before i d installed nsw  at that point i had nsw  installed  i had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry  norton s automated uninstall failed over and over so i gave up on that and did it by hand  then i installed nsw  with nav  when i went to install nav  it was unable to uninstall the old version  so i had to restore the system again  this time i installed nsw  without nav  i was then able to install nav  it is working now  it just should nt be this difficult
__label__1 getting great pictures from this new flash for my sony digital slr camera
__label__1 it took me all of  hours to read this book  it was insightful and entertaining  it was also sad  i cried so hard at the end of the book that i hiccuped for  hours  i work at a children s home and have passed this book to several of my  children  who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve  i highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face any type of challenge  whether mental  physical  financial  whatever
__label__1 i love this product  it is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from
__label__0 i was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad  since i just returned mine after one use  perhaps the one i got was defective  but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and was nt hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle  i also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area  and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear  the placement of the strap does nt allow the pad to conform to the body  but only to press against it where the strap runs through  just the center  not the rest of the pad  i realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm  but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly  for the time being i ll keep wearing thermacare  tm  back wraps  which are expensive  could have bought two heating pads by now  but do last  hours at a time and provide intense enough heat  also  this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where i need it  if you need intense heat for a sore back  i d skip this heating pad
__label__1 for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something  you could nt do better than to give them this cd  ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm  plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach  making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer  this is not a bad thing some complain that bach  with his mathematical leanings  leaves them cold  that is nt possible with the inviting material on this cd
__label__1 i found this movie delightful from the storyline  directing and photography to the actors  i especially loved the performances of timothy bottoms and chloris leachman  it s an enlightening movie that makes an important point  sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all
__label__1 i own an older dispensor  from around   and i was afraid that these filters would nt fit  they do and seem to work fine  i ca nt find a  replace  indicator on these new ones  the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them  i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis  they say the filters are good for  months
__label__1 never in my life have i seen a film dedicated to the subject of vichy france  i had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government  i assumed that the sorrow and the pity was strictly a documentary about the french resistance  but was pleasantly surprised by its depth  it describes the vichy of petain and laval quite thoroughly  you may recognize some of ophuls  interviewees from the world at war  such as edward spears   but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss  i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit  frankly  i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face  his point that the slaughter of    french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered  it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england given the competition but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after  the rout  of may  the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists  it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain  at first  and looked sympathetically to the nazis  the speeches  the newsreels  and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting  especially if you re a history buff  i d rank this one right up there with hotel terminus
__label__0 having owned several panasonic wet  dry shavers over a  year period i can  with authority  say that this model is a big disappointment  the battery life is outstanding  but that s because the motor speed is so slow it s not using much juice  and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor  the next time i wo nt pinch pennies  the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference
__label__0 let me start by saying that normally i m a big popcorn fan  i read any article that she s quoted in  i ve read  the popcorn report  at least twice and loved it  the same for  clicking   great book  they re part of my permanent library  so i was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of eveolution  i hung in there as long as i could  but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way  i just could nt tolerate reading any more  perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people s view  but i did nt see how they fit in with the intent of the book  the comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary  so hopefully her next book will be better
__label__0 everything the negative reviewers say is true and more  please note the following as well   if you are a college student taking a class online that uses blackboard software  vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fillintheblank or discussion questions on tests  to fix this download the foxfire browser  free  and use it to access your course  because vista uses so much memory and is already so huge  they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the operating system   huge memory and hard drive drain  look at this comparison windows xp professional size on drive  gig memory requirements  mb windows vista needs  gig to load  does not say how large the program is but i would nt think its small    memory requirements  gig  if you check the dell website you will see that they recommend that you have  gig of memory to use windows vista  that is a few  worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program  try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system  the less memory you have available  the slower everything  including websites will load  no matter how fast your internet connection  what is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it  ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system   they will have to add patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory  this is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that i have ever seen  i would expect some lawsuits before this is over  do not buy this product
__label__0 the mirror did not work  the lights and clock did not work and i did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up  i would have to get a new box and take it to the ups place to send it which would have cost me about another  and quite frankly  it was just not worth the time nor the money
__label__0 dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer  unfortunately  the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts  songs that seem formulaic and  quot  safe  quot  his best songs are the lesser known works   listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them  they ll never make it to the pop airwaves  serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd   quot  greatest hitsquot  is not synonymous with  quot  greatest music  quot
__label__0 this went up from one  in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii  but otherwise its just a mess  the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble  but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes  who also gave us such film masterpieces as  casino royale  and  chitty chitty bang bang   richard harris is his usually unrestrained self  and thats not a compliment  now  i wont even go into the politics  which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero  as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas s paean to charles ii in  twenty years after   but nowhere near as entertaining

__label__0 for years  i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life  that included every event  every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity  the subject was beyond fascinating  as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge  existing   however  i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject  knowing of mr cayce s tremendous psychic following  i assumed this book would enlighten me and others  i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend  after trudging through the first  pages  i felt lost and befuddled  the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in  layperson s  language  perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect  one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the longwinded case histories to discover meaning and relevance  my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two  then set it aside  pie dumas author  life coach
__label__1 this camera is amazing  out of the  digital camera s under  i ve used  this is by far the best  beating out the kodak and the sipix  i originally bought the sipix  and it was junk  do nt buy the sipix that s under  the kodak for some reason did nt seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix  but the software was a little better  being from kodak  this camera can take pictures of resolution up to  megapixels  but i do nt even use that option because the  megapixel pictures are so amazing  it comes with a mb removable memory card  so you can take around  pics at mp  around  at mp  and it takes short videos for about  seconds in mpeg format at a  x  resolution  or more on a lower setting  the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power  and the  aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long  it has a nice  sleak design  and the software has no issues with windows xp at least  the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is x digital zoom  which is pretty much useless  and i never use it  since it s the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer  so you can consider it not having any zoom  the software for it works well  but it could be better  options wise  the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card  so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day  since it creates folders based on date   you ll have to rename each pic  but i hardly complain  since the pictures come out so incredibly well  i m so happy with this camera  if you want a camera under   this is the one to get  do nt even waste your time with the kodak  unless you want the one with x optical zoom  but that s  i use it for general purpose  taking pictures of freinds and such  once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at mp  and that will be photo quality printed on a full page  mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images  and mp will created good smaller images to put on websites  there s no reason to buy anything else  go with the fuji finepix a

__label__0 cruel  horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot  the abuse of children  evil ranger poising as a dead ranger  freaky religious sect  dead animals on the bed  and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me  i ve read many barr books  and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters  it s hard to keep them straight  in this book  that was the last of my worries  i did nt even finish it  i was so turned off
__label__0 this was not as good as i had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while i am working out but the rest is good
__label__1 i believe this is one of the best lens for about  forget about zoom lenses even if they are l  this lens is far better than l in my opinion  it is very sharp at f and even more sharp at f with zoom lenses you have to set to f   for better result and f   to match this lens  it is very well built but not excessive heavy  come with hood and bag  but unfortunately  canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses  combined with a tamron x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at mm focal length  yes i know i lost the convenience of a  zoom lens  but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a is to   lx  this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures  especially at wide open  better portrait lenses  like    and     would cost several thousands of dollars  trust me  once you play with primes  you will not like zoom anymore  i am also using a l to shoot my small kid  after using this lens  i do nt like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday  the only reason preventing me doing that is the x crop factor of digital camera  a mm  l will become mm which is really not good  order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock  they shipped mine in  days and this happened before even though item stated  in stock soon   pros  very sharp at f and super sharp start from f very fast lens with f   very good bokeh  background blurring   overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast  color  smaller size  less weight and black color compare to those white s  it is a l lens  best build quality  fast  quiet ring usm af with ftm  cons  no hard case  no inexpensive  effective focal length is mm on d  d  rebel  d which is a little difficult to use for portrait

__label__0 it was difficult to stay  tunedin  to this book  a few good ideas  but nothing new or different  it is not a book that i would recommend  however  i might try to listen again   just to see if i missed the point  i certainly would not give this book as a gift
__label__0 my hunting buddy purchased a nikon  my intent was to put him in the shade  that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro  tried new batteries  tried bluffing  even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past    yards  my opinion is this product is not worth the postage  anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product

__label__1 the language  the words  the concepts  the illustrations  the points he brings out  everything in this book is beautiful  the metaphors he will use to get a certain point across  is brilliant  simple  creative  nimble  he dances around philosophical discussion with grace  he explains relativism  and absolutism  quite well  and puts you in the crossfire  to make up your mind  he shows you  but does nt tell you  he offers you  he willingly gives you  the truth  buy this book

__label__1 i recently purchased this cd again  i once owned it on cassette  keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early s  if you are building an old school collection with great singers this is a good one to have  it s great for romance or with that special lady  jaye price beltsville md

__label__1 the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed  they are art  not just stories  each story is deep in its unique complexities  each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader s mind  and when i look back upon the book as a whole  upon the adventurous stories  the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely  i ca nt help but be extremely impressed
__label__1 i must agree with the comments made by other reviewers  this album is great  nancy wilson s voice on this album is unlike anything i have ever heard  you ca nt honestly say you re a fan of jazz if you do nt own this
__label__1 miller knows his subjects  the people  and his subject  their desperation  with a clarity and fearlessness that most people would prefer to avoid  viewing his photographs are no easier a task than living wholly and honestly  skinheads  speedfreaks  tenderloin whores  friends and neighbors  lucid  terrifying  and ultimately beautiful photographs from a man of the same qualities

__label__1 as you can see by other reviews above  the studio series has a history of being buggy  you also hear a lot of people saying  this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other  powerful enough to be worth owning  packages   if only it were more stable   i am one of those longsuffering users   years  going back to version    and finally with version  i have stopped complaining   it now works as i d hoped when i bought it  the  i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted   i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a page manual could nt clarify  and i m a very sophisticated computer user by most measures  i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd s into dvds  i use studio for all the editing  have not tried the dvd recording   just use roxio for that  and am now very pleased  if you own  then version  is a free download  one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems  put every  project  you work on in a separate subdirectory  if you have  soccer game videos make a  game   game etc series of subfolders  if you edit those to a  jimmy s great plays  proect  put it in a separate  jimmyplays folder  when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in  i learned this trick before  came out  and i do nt know if it matters any more but i take no chances  why did i stick with something where i admit that version  was  powerful but unstable  and  was  more powerful and more unstable   because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions  and when i use it things turn out as i expect  now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer  so that s how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it  stars on this review  i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions  but that   updated for free to   really is the best choice out there now  as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove  just keep putting every project inn its own folder

__label__0 seven times the sun is not for everyone  it could be a springboard  offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life  but the songs  poems and traditions offered in shea darian s book are hokey and contrived at best  cumbersome and artificial at worst  none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book  darian is a minister  and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent  true  parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have  but i m just thankful amazon has a customerfriendly return policy
__label__1 if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper  then this is the brand and variant you should switch to  if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises  rapidly dissolves    i d have to give it five stars  it practically melts as soon as it touches water  do nt expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink  you ll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue  i m giving it only four stars  because it s not my favorite toilet paper  that would be charmin ultra   but the necessary choice

__label__1 i saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in   but i did nt pay too close attention  because i forgot about it  however  i remembered seeing it in theaters one day when i was browsing the dvd section  and decided to give it another shot at home  i am so glad i did  leelee sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film  she has a bright future in acting ahead of her  basically what happens is  ruby  sobieski  and her brother rhett s  trevor morgan  parents die in a car accident  their parents wished for them to go live with the family s former neighbors  the glasses   who had since moved to malibu  played by stellan skarsgard and diane lane  needless to say  ruby and rhett s carefree lives are changed dramatically  rhett falls for all the gifts that the glasses buy for him  but ruby is nt fooled so easily  she begins to suspect that her parents  death was nt an accident  and starts to investigate  she sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the glasses that only make her more suspicious  eventually  she figures out that the glasses are behind the car accident and are now after ruby and rhett s  million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents  i wo nt give away the rest  but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second  rent it  or better yet  buy it  it s well worth your while

__label__1 very happy with this purchase  received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an  credit card  it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors  i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily  good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently  also  the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
__label__0 my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake  with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great  i was wrong  it was pure hollywood garbage
__label__1 nikon has always been the leader in photography  camera  lenses  others have nobly tried but a nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach  when the shift from film to digital began  there was some speculation if nikon could keep up with the competition  well  rest assure that not only have they kept up  they continue to lead the way  the latest example of this is the d like the d  d  this is a solid piece of equipment  just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology  but the proof will always be in the end results and again  the combination of the nikon knowhow and nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures  gone is the  lag between shots   you can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours  without even  tweaking  a picture with a computer program  you can print top of the line photos at home  people have cited the cons  expensive  yes  the camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers  if you are a  vacation and holiday  picture taker  then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera  the same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons  dials and switches  there are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the  point and shoot  school of picture taking  anyone else will relish the options that nikon has provided us with on the d room for improvement  well  the battery life is nowhere near as good as the d which i upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge  also  it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models  so if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready  this is the one for you
__label__0 while  talk to the hand  is inescapably mediocre in comparison to  eats  shoots  leaves   a book i found amusing  though not uptopar to its new york times bestseller status  this book does have its moments  however  i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that  despite whatever way she meant it  ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice  i find it interesting that she  or at least her editors  did not further investigate the disease  which  indeed  gluten tolerance is  before publishing such a degrading remark  oh  yes  bloody well sorry  ms truss  for invading your rude  stayhomeandboltthedoor causitive world with yet another irritation which  i m sure  someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet  let s just go and  well  obliterate a genetic disorder  while we re at it  we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk  if it pleases and thanks you  ms truss  we celiacs will eat cake   oh  bloody hell  did i just say  please    despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place  i have to wonder if she s experiencing the effects of projection  in explaining how rude we humans are  it was necessary for her to be quite rude  as well  it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer  i also found her supermarket incident  in which a kid shouts at his mother   i want that one  you effing bitch    among others  a bit offensive  as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness  i was often thoroughly appalled by this book  no  my friends and i do nt usually hold doors for each other  but  in general  i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown  frankly  i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends  as well as strangers  than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others  i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation  or  if they must answer  they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them  i have to argue that we are not a select group  in today s world  one sees what one expects to see  one is treated as one expects to be treated  ms truss  i believe  would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could  she would be surprised to find that  when people are rude  she cares less because she knows that she  at least  is doing her best not to be  if she did this  maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior  my last complaint is this   gluten crap   you would think that such a sophisticated  eloquent  as she is dedicated to proving  person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the thirdyear  aminotsocoolandbitchin     style word  crap
__label__0 for fans  i suppose this would be a rather big delight  for nonfans  it s nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey  they had some okay  cheesy hits in the  s  but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays
__label__0 when converting my  data over to  version it lost all of my time data  i have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now  also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer  i ve had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones  intuit s support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems  i have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer  my recommendation is if you are using the  version  and do nt need tax tables  do nt mess with  version  it has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own
__label__1 despite reading glowing reviews about this lens  i was still surprised to see how well it performed  the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes  from a distance of three quarters of a football field away  shooting hand held  with late afternoon light  which will print a x and still look like a pro took them  if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca nt afford  or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures  then you should give this lens your serious consideration
__label__1 this lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality  it compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk  might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul
__label__1 the product is easy to use  like how it intergrates with ms office applications  it s been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
__label__1 i just bought this for about  at the local px  i am impressed so far  i was going to buy the gs  but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up  so far the low light is much better than a single ccd  the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape  i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale  i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe  i look froward to using this camcorder a lot
__label__0 i can not stand this book  i ca nt even finish reading it  kevin j anderson can not write original star wars books at all  the only thing i have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the dark lords of the sith comic book  everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story  he seems to have some obsession with death stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those  darksaber  jedi search  dark apprentice  champions of the force  heck even the ig story he wrote for tales of the bounty hunters had the death star tied in  ig transfers himself into the death starwhat the heck   seriously  this book is not worth it  try timothy zahn or michael stackpole  at least they do nt always use death stars  and while zahn s last  books are based around thrawn  the original heir to the empire  dark force rising and the last command  when thrawn first appeared  was not him dry humping the same concept over and over
__label__1 i purchased this case for my canon a camera  i find that it does a great job of being light  durable  and compact  it keeps the camera clean and scratch free  however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity  i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips  i use different ones for different pictures or video  batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy  the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn  that can be a bit akward  otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well
__label__1 i have a question about this  i m wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it  is that possible on this program  cause my friend has acid pro  and that is really awesome but it s like  and i dont have that kinda money  wut i liked about acid pro  is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that  so im wondering if you can do that on this program  if u have an answer for me  email me at peepilottaolcom
__label__0 if you are short on money  do not buy this cd you will regret it  however if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good  especially the dr evil  quot  just the two of usquot   really this is not a good album  as side two is rubbish  i still have nt listened to it all the way throug
__label__0 this whole post crap grunge is crap  if you want real rock check out gnr  acdc  and any band pre grunge  i know this is a review but how does this grab ya  oh and i wo nt mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom   quot  oh how did we wind up like this   quot  exactly what i m trying to figure out  tesla s got more talent then all these bands and they ca nt get any airplay give me a break
__label__1 i am very satisfied with nizoral antidandruff shampoo  many antidandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough  i have thick  waistlength hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage  unlike some antidandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell  nizoral has a pleasant fragrance  i ll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo
__label__0 this dude is selling info that you can learn from anyone with very limited computer knowledge  all of the same info is on the net for free  this product exists for one purpose  to steal from you  this pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card  bucks a month without their permission  he could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product  but scams seem to be his thing  avoid   this is the worst company that i have ever delt with in my entire life  this john guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed  he is an embarrasement to his company and his family  at least a mugger steals from me face to face  this snake is sneaky about it
__label__1 nothing deep  by any means  but simply a light  airy listen  with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes  even though the songs  most of them  were nt in the movie  they remind me of it  of the whole hawaiian atmosphere  my favorite tracks  excluding the ones included on the previous cd  are blue hawaii  by elvis   my little grass shack  coconut  it s just bizarre  but addicting  making you smile with absurdity   island in the sun  pineapple princess  and love me tender  again  it s nothing dramatic or swirling  but it you adored lilo  amp  stitch  and how can you not   and all it stood for  this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day  do nt think about it  listen and pretend you re there
__label__0 the problem with this game starts with the introductury movie  it develops slowly  goes on forever  suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play  once game play finally does start  my child found the games boring and the transitions between the games tediously slow  cute characterszero edutainment  it was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day
__label__0 this is an overpriced  under designed lounger  the concept is cool  the product is not  the idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses  very uncomfortable  i am glad i bought mine from amazon as opposed to the  plus other retailers wanted last summer
__label__1 i m biased  because i loved the movie and adore the book  gregsonwilliams does an outstanding job here  before this  i was most familiar with his score work on metal gear solid videogames   the music is extremely touching and magical  the  evacuating london score   from the scene in the train station  tugs at the heartstrings  and the  battle score  brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie s climax  one song that s missing is the s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek  other than that absence  probably due to copyright restrictions   this is an excellent cd  as for the  bonus  dvd  i probably would nt purchase it if i had a second chance  it s got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art  there is only one trailer  and it is not the very first one released  which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin  with its intro of the wardrobe  there are also behindthescenes interviews i have nt watched yet  but i wonder if they ll appear again when the movie dvd is released
__label__0 when it comes to big star s  s output  you can call me a hopeless fanboy  because after listening to in space  it seems that only a hopeless fanboy would think that thirtysomeyears later  exactly onehalf of the classic big star lineup could or in forever difficult alex chilton s case  would be so inclined to attempt to recapture the lightninginabottle transcedent pop magic that made those s discs so great  this disc has way more in common with chilton s ofttimes difficult  mostly selfindulgent solo work than with any of big star s previous fascinating pop nearperfection  while i ll admit that i have enjoyed a good chunk of chilton s solo work   in a slightly guilty  rollingmyeyes   ohthat alex   sorta way   my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that this group and that this particular collection of songs are presented as  big star   in space is connected musically to the original big star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in this band were in that band  if you do nt expect much  you wo nt be disappointed
__label__1 this is a most beautiful movie  i can  t imagine anyone not enjoying it  the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone
__label__0 there are just some trilogy s that should not be made  and the wild things trilogy is one of them  this is not really a trilogy per se  since each of the films carries with it the same story  with the same twists  if you have seen the first  you have basically seen each of the sequels  except the sequels are both much worse  take out the big name actors and make a directtodvd release  and you have wild things  diamonds in the rough  i am sure you all know the story by now  but here is a brief synopsis   things get steamy in blue bay  florida  when marie  a yearold beauty  gets caught in a tangle of deceit and doublecrossing after meeting the promiscuous elena  the new girl at school  will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme  if you have seen one of the wild things films  you have seen them all  this film lacks the quality of the original  mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come  this disc does look great  and sounds pretty good  but the film takes away from the overall dvd presentation  if you want your wild things fix  the original version is the one to watch
__label__0 i hate this product  i receive it as a gift  and all the products are not adapted for babies  plus  looks very cheap
__label__1 i ve had this camera for three years  i bought it new  when it was cutting edge and very expensive  i put a mb cf card in it  first  i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software  i ve probably taken upwards of  pictures with it  it s been all over the country  the software has been installed on windows      and xp and i have nt had any problems with it  the camera is solid  performs well  takes good pictures  and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder  if battery life were that big a deal  one could purchase a second battery and rotate  all that said  i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera  they are razor sharp  the color balance is perfect  and the focus is great  when taking pictures of people  however  it shows every flaw in the subject s skin  scratches  oil  freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific  it requires extensive photoshopping to fix the flaws  other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better  i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture  by the time the shot s taken  something  especially a squirmy child or a sports play  has invariably moved and it s not the exact picture you wanted  i m going to buy a real singlelens reflex  slr  to take baby pictures  but i ll keep this as a travel camera
__label__0 do you feel different from people around you  do they resent your ingenuity  have you been kept from achieving your full potential by traditionbound brutes who live only for base needs  do you long for the company of others like yourself  who  tragically but inevitably  are biologically destined to wipe these shorter  darker subhumans from the face of the earth  congratulations  you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club  possibly both   i exaggerate  you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia  or a boer in south africa  or maybe you just like larry niven  but that s beside the point  i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book  in the late  s when she did her research  we did nt have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals  and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia  ultimately we ll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like  and auel s is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion  similarly  her bloated  almost puffy writing style is excusable in a firsttime author  though one wonders what parasite infected her editor  i have nt read her more recent works  but i imagine she has probably improved  even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable  what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story  nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged  the story reads like a nearliteral historicization of helena blavatsky s secret doctrine on the fall of the  aryans   who interbred with  subhumans  introducing the world to  oh i dunno  domination by the unworthy  blind tradition  suppression of the individual  all the hallmarks of the book s neanderthal culture  of course  even in this the blondhaired blueeyed ayla is innocent  overpowered by a brutish thug  against this master narrative  all the admittedly interesting side notes about plantbased medicine and flintknapping make no impression  i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet  and give auel s books a wide berth  also  enough rape scenes already
__label__1 this product is so good  i love it  i can make my own mp s  make disk copies and archive data files  i m curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product  i m very happy with this item  the price is very pleasing as well
__label__1 got this on ebay for  last year  a great deal  i am only bothering to rate this as it seems ridiculous that is rated below two other rather shoddy grant collections because of the holiday backlash  objectively rating the content instead of the marketing would work for me
__label__1 rites of spring is an unparalleled work of cultural and historical synthesis  and easily the most interesting cultural history of th century europe available
__label__0 bought the samsung  from amazon and it developed mechanical fault while i was test running  making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable  about  weeks later  i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again  problem with the power system  paralysing it completely  all in less than  wks from purchase  left it plugged to charge for  days without difference it s indeed a sad story  that would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder
__label__0 i have had this camera since jan   and have so far taken approximately    shots while on trips and at weddings  do nt expect much from it and you will be happy  as an entry level dslr it does what it s supposed to do in ideal conditions  i find it s strength is in taking people photographs in bright light  provided that they are not moving  cons  in landscape photography this camera is lacking  both due to inadequate megapixels and it s inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well  battery dies fast  the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting  especially when shooting in raw mode  i have yet to fill up a gig card when shooting in raw mode  approx  shots  before the battery dies  surprisingly when shooting jpegs  i get more shots per charge  over   but hardly enough to last a day  i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike  so i always carry a backup film camera  my trusty elan    the viewfinder is very dim  when i look through my elan  and then through the d  it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the d s viewfinder  in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap  especially when having to resort to manual focus  autofocus in low light for the d is terrible  when shooting indoors  the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject  i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur  this is despite having a ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus  the ex flash is supposed to  talk  to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed  however  with the d  this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over  under exposed  after about five months  the shutter button started sticking  i would click it and then it would remain depressed  the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little  another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button  and since there is only one thumbwheel  it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed  for example  if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature  then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel  when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera  this is a real annoyance  so would i recommend this camera  if you are a casual point and shoot person  it s an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos  but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately  look elsewhere

__label__1 i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years  it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist  it works for me  but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing  brushing  and generally good tooth care
__label__0 i was expecting a lot more from these two cds  it teaches you a few items of food  basic words like  hello   please  and  airplane  and even teaches you to ask  where are the suitcases   but then that is about it  i was really hoping for more  much more
__label__0 this program is average to below average in it s abilities  that said  just hope you do nt need any roxio tech support  why  because roxio s support bites  you cannot contact anyone online or by email for help  whenever their disfunctional  web portal  webbased support system traps you in an endless loop  i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet  it used to be you could download roxio s patches from any pc having internet access  then burn patchs to a cd  or copy to floppy  jumpdrive  then  sneakernet  the patches to the pc needing them  no more  what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download  patch a roxio product directly on my pc  ezcd does nt exist on my pc instead of simply letting me download it somewhere  like to my hard drive  vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc  which wo nt work in my case as i m not using roxio  nor have it installed on my pc  apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download  patch process stop  end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio s initial patch download page  when you need a patch  all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product  different company  if you want to minimize human contact with customers  fine  but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going  do nt hand over your customer support system almost completely to a web server  that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls  then they let customers wade through a  layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem  it just does nt work  if a company wo nt provide access to patches  even after i have logged into their website with username and password  so they know is accessing their patches and they do nt offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option  then i sure as heck wo nt be buying anymore of their products  i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies  though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that when a competitor has a better product  why fight to improve your prodsuct s quality  features  when you can buy the other company out  thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella

__label__0 bands from the s just sucked and nirvana fits in with that  they had a couple of ok songs and kurt cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about  i can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were  i do nt see it  this is another cd in a long line of cds from the s that are a disgrace to music
__label__1 i put off buying this for many years  having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous  i did nt want to taint my perceptions of the queen legacy  so i ignored this album  then  one day  i was listening to innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again  i came here and read many positive reviews  so i took the plunge  i came out the other side very content  the legacy had not been tainted  the album is uneven in places  but the songs that are good are very good  mother love  let me live   with some albums like this  it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in  now  i do nt know exactly how this was done  but the songs feel seamless  even the dance track  you do nt fool me   which i can picture being blasted at high volumes in a latenight club  of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out  especially in  mother love    but upon the conclusion of the album  i want to say to the brian and the boys  men    you ve done good
__label__1 my sony fx has great low light capability   lux  but eventually you will need extra light  using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess  no matter which camera you use  i m so glad i bought it  used it for my birthday party  though the overhead light was good  dark corners of the room require more light  if you consider yourself advanced  semipro  or a pro videographer  you must have a light  my only major beef is it runs at either  or  watts  no variable for   or  it is worth getting a long life battery like the np independent power source  battery  is a plus  but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of

__label__0 i was intrigued by the title  which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity  well  after  pages or so  i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that  the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life  but  i say that any religious life  be it christian  islam or otherwise  is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional  i am convinced that yoda is a zen master  the force is derived from tao  not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion  i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism  which is another beast altogether    a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is  the dharma of star wars
__label__0 george clooney and quentin tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time  it s sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys  this whole flick is akin to getting a giftwrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper  problem is  as is often the case with tarantino and robert rodriguez  ai nt nothin  inside the package  get it  these guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever  the word shallow comes to mind  there is nothing there  and i doubt that there ever will be  however  having said that  i must give credit where credit is due  juliette lewis  the talented juliette lewis  is terrific as usual  good to see harvey keitel do his thing  same goes for fred williamson  the rarely seen michael parks  this guy  by the way made some terrific countrytype records back in the s and we wish he d do more  he s up there with merle haggard in my humble opinion  and  last but not least  the beautiful salma hayek is also in this  although she hardly does enough  she still had the curves back then  in addition to the above  we could have done without all the obvious and crappy cgi effects at the end  the stuff just does nt work  never did  by the way  the documentary full tilt boogie is way better than the main feature

__label__0 i found this product to represent extremely poor value for money  i purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials  however  i have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials  this product only covers the basics  levels      then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels  i have since purchased a cheaper  tell me more  package  for spanish  and have been highly impressed with the scope of it  they have packed so much more value into their package  and it is a complete package  all the way to advanced level  i think it s really disgusting that rosetta stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it  i think it borders on being a scam

__label__1 long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual  song and dance  i have come to believe that the  old ways  were in many cases the superior mode of transmission  mere words could never convey the multifaceted beauty  wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance  this point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of  holo mai pele    holo mai pele  is an exciting and exotic multimedia production that i found absoultely engrossing  the director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio  the onstage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting hawaiian landscape  the onstage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions  lava flows and lush tropical rainforests  all of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano goddess pele and her battle with her youngest sister hiiaka  the narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance  this dvd serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the hawaiian  spirit of aloha   truly a sacred visual document to be treasured
__label__0 i read other review  and decided to give it a try  as soon as i recieve it in the mail  and opened the box  i realized this was a mistake  cheap quality binocular with  high power  being a selling point  it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart  you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place  it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation  you will be constantly ajdusting the focus  your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it  indeed strap  case  lense protectors are all cheap crap  and annoying to have it all on  i am taking this back  and buying made in japan  nikon eagle view   times better  you get what you pay for
__label__1 this is the same charger came with my digital rebel  however  i like to charge two batteries at a time  so  i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip  the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact  flat and easy to take along with you  it s nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with
__label__0 i m not a tech guy  but from a simple user s standpoint  there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance  about    the software you might have purchased that worked with xp wo nt work with vista  i was thinking that vista would be an improvement  but there is nothing there  just some minor superficial changes as far as i can tell  maybe for it people  there might be some big difference  but for your average user  there is no improvement at all  save your money  do nt buy it
__label__1 mathau and lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like  grumpy old men   the plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship
__label__1 this full complement of these classic right hand exercises is found in scott tennant s  quot  pumping nylonquot   which also provides an appropriate context in which to use giuliani s studies
__label__1 this is an enlightening  meticulous story of william  boss  tweed and  as past of the context  his three key cronies in the ring  peter sweeny  richard connolly and oakley hall  it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page  oh how the mighty have fallen  the time of power  terror   for tweed s edition of tammany hall was relatively short  but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed s demise  another eithyfive years  the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city  putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves  the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves  primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build  a disgruntled  whistleblower   the term had no meaning back then  copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud  there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times  hands  but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the  ring  could be  how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe  cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings  people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people s friend   the government   can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution  the cast of characters  sinners   few  saints  and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task  thomas nast  a pivotal character if not the hero of the book  provides some vivid  visual signposts  nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate  readers   he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today s politicians  nast s giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story  it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail  a few maps  perhaps some old drawings  and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast  there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context  any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed s nefarious deeds and nast s colorful cartoons  ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing  filling in the gaps  and bringing now faded  blackandwhite characters back to life
__label__1 seems to hold a charge just as well or better then the original one that came with the camer

__label__0 the videoediting component of this package  video wave  worked great for me for about a year  but it has recently turned into a nightmare  the audio is anywhere between  and  seconds out of sync with the video  and after trying everything i m convinced that its a problem with the code  a quick product search will show others who have had similar problems  i would stay away
__label__0 this is another piece of lowbrow antigerman propaganda dressed as historiography  the book is a mess of primary  yet selective and biased historical research  simplistic psychobabble  ridiculous sociologicalanthropological speculation  pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least  absolutely third rate military history  the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler  that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives  all in all  cheap trash billed as history
__label__1 i bought this album when it was first released in the s  heaven and hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst  those kids in the know  in much the same way that a joint would these days  the movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures  only later in life could i get the similarities to carl orf and khachaturian  this is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when prog really was prog  listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside camel s  the snow goose   the original  tubular bells  by mike oldfield   brain salad surgery  by elp and finally  snowflakes are dancing  by tomita  please dont compare this work to the keybored pop  i chose my spelling  of the  s if you enjoy vangelis  as i do  you might also want to listen to the compositions of ennio morricone  he is the man who wrote that great music that follows clint eastwood in the sergio leone spaghetti westerns
__label__1 given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt frontpage was a a really big help  i was able to get a website up and running in about  weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering  i did nt realize though that frontpage is nt the cureall for making a website really  primarily only for web design ie if you want to make a website with ecommerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like  you re gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in asp or php  but as far as web design goes frontpage can take a novice a long way
__label__0 or in their entire career for that matter  i have tried to like this band  but greg dulli just wo nt shut up  every song is his snide lyrical diatribing  on and on and on  the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting  but on this album in particular  the drummer also wo nt shut up and play a straight beat for once  it s like three guys in their own worlds  and they mash it together and call what they ve done songs  except for the one decent song they did  the only rock song i can think of that is hard  psychedelic  passionate  powerful  and set to a waltz beat of all things   let me lie to you  is the best song they ever made  because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song s framework and tempo  instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do  everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses  and it s less muddled and better orchestrated for it  it s a shame they did nt do any other songs like this  at least none that i have heard  i tried to like them  i really did  i wanted to find the band that made that one song  and discover a whole treasure chest of dark  passionate  noisy music like that  too bad  no wonder they drifted apart
__label__1 this software was easy to install  the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated  i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me  the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood  my one wish is that there were more varied games included  but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging
__label__1 la bamba    the soundtrack to the ritchie valens biopic of the same name  introduction  in   the film la bamba  based on the life and times of fifties poprock star ritchie valens  was released  the film cast lou diamond phillips as the classic musician  and told his story  from his rise to fame  right down to his young and tragic death  for the film  los lobos  a fairly popular act of the day  was asked to rerecord classic valens material for the movie  some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film  so  how is the soundtrack  read on  and find out  overview  the la bamba soundtrack was released in   around the same time as the film of the same name  contributors to the soundtrack include los lobos  howard huntsberry  marshall crenshaw  brian setzer  and bo diddley  the aside of the soundtrack sonsists of the los lobos covers of the ritchie valens songs la bamba  come on lets go  ooh my head  we belong together  framed  and donna  the bside consists of the other artists  covers  which include howard huntsberry s cover of jackie wilson s lonely teardrops  marshall crenshaw s cover of buddy holly s crying waiting hoping  brian setzer s cover of eddie cochran s summertime blues  bo diddley s remake of his own classic tune who do you love  and the two songs los lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes  charlena and goodnight my love  review  awesome movie  awesome soundtrack  i m a huge fan of the music of ritchie valens  and for the most part  la bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the valens saga  aside from some omitted material  which i ll get to later   the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents  read on for my reviews of the tracks  side a  la bamba by los lobos  los lobos covers the track that took ritchie valens to the top of the musical world  being a folk song  no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well  valens proved the nonbelievers wrong  los lobos does a great cover of it  too  the band actually did two versions of the song for the movie  a rendition of the slower  folksier version by the bar band that convinced valens to cover the song himself  as well as the classic version valens did  this is the classic valens version  i wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack  though  although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version does reprise elements of the folktype version  still  i wanted both versions as complete  separate tracks   come on lets go by los lobos  this classic rockabillystyle cut was another huge hit for ritchie valens  los lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut  staying true to the valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things  all in all  another great song  ooh my head by los lobos  not much to say about this one  once again  los lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic valens tunes people know and love him for  every song on this soundtrack is excellent  and this one is no exception  we belong together by los lobos  ah  the classic valens love song  although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad donna  this one was still a fairly notable hit for valens  the los lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one  but i should nt have to tell you that  now should i  framed by los lobos  of all of the ritchie valens song that los lobos revisited in la bamba  this one is the least well known  that s a shame  because it s a great song  the song takes a classic blues styling  and puts a rockabilly spin on it  once again  los lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song  donna by los lobos  this song was so big a hit for ritchie valens initially  that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is la bamba  the classic ode valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time  and i know you re probably getting tired of me saying this for every song  but los lobos really does a good job on here  side b  lonely teardrops by howard huntsberry  in la bamba  howard huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer jackie wilson  and here  huntsberry reprises wilson s signature tune  this is classic soul at its very best  prior to seeing la bamba  i had never even heard of huntsberry  but the real shocker is that i ended up liking this version of the song more than the original  definitely a solid  underrated cut  crying waiting hoping by marshall crenshaw  marshall crenshaw  a fairly popular eighties pop signer  managed to land the role of buddy holly in la bamba  holly  of course  was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of ritchie valens  buddy holly is a tough guy to cover  but marshall crenshaw does a damn good job of it  i personally prefer this version over holly s original  and that s saying a lot since i love buddy holly   if you re interested in hearing crenshaw cover another holly tune  check out the remastered version of his  selftitled debut  he covers rave on on there as a bonus track  summertime blues by brian setzer  long before brian setzer gained any real fame  he played eddie cochran in la bamba  covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend  here s another one of those covers that is so good  i like it more than the original  definitely worthwhile listening  but then again  is nt every song on here  who do you love by bo diddley  bo diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago  and was asked to rerecord it for la bamba  he did  and the end results are solid  diddley is a legend of the blues  and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way  it just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the george thorogood one  because diddley s version is the song the way it was meant to be heard  charlena by los lobos  in addition to the ritchie valens covers  los lobos recorded two new songs for the la bamba soundtrack  this is the first of the two  essentially  this here is a neorockabilly track of sorts  and a damn good one too  long after the fifties music scene died out  los lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly  goodnight my love by los lobos  here s the second of the newlyrecorded los lobos songs done for the soundtrack  what we have here is one of those classic fiftiesstyle rock ballads that were so popular back then  if you re into that sort of thing  you re going to love this song  i know i do  other comments  omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack  by far  as i previously stated  only one version of la bamba is on here  not both versions from the film  another omission is sleepwalk  the classic santo and johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film  its omission is likely due to the fact that it was nt recorded just for the film  but still  i miss it  and then there s the issue of rip it up  the classic ritchie valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage  early on in the film  this was one of my favorite songs in the film  and i was devastated not to see it on here  and where s the big bopper s chantilly lace  i rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions  if these songs had been on here  it would be five stars all the way  overall  overall  despite my issues with the omitted songs  i am very satisfied with the la bamba soundtrack  much like the movie  it s an excellent experience all the way through  if you liked the movie  or you re just into this sort of music  the soundtrack is well worth owning  highly recommended  edition notes  this soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc  implying it may be very gradually going out of print  take my advice  if you want it  just buy it online  it s the fastest  easiest way to get it
__label__0 i looked through this book at a craft store the other day  and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells  i found maybe one project in here that i would consider making  just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate  unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish  i would nt recommend this book  try to find  decorating with seashells  by anita louise cran

__label__1 zig ziglar has done it again  as an author myself of sales books  i realize sales is about so much more than just having the  gift of gab   and fast talking  it s about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers  it s about not just being a consultant to others  but being a consultant to yourself  it s recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is  zig s theories exemplify this

__label__0 in this sixth  but not final  installment of the movie series  what we get is little story and too much senseless action  with a sprinkling of hot tub sex   this is a very disappointing film  although it is the last such lwnc movie from this creative team  it does not end the storyline  with  volumes in the manga series  we probably would have needed another  films   so the patient  constant viewer gets instead a hackandslash film of midcaliber  the ending   an overextending action sequence set on a snowy slope   is very unsatisfying  so are the characters  unlike other lwnc films  we do not get to meet any new incidental characters  as a result  the film is less about  edo  soceity  which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team  and instead just a big showdown waiting to happenwaiting  waiting to happen  the film is way too long and its pacing is horrible  i think the fault with the film lies in these two things    the writers  filmmakers chose poor source material  the  five wheel  assassin team denies itto and son the chance to mingle with regular edo joes  as a result  you do not get as i argued the best part of the series  the rich detail of edo life    the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with james bond films like  on her majesty s secret service  and whatnot with their decision to make this movie  samurai on skis   after the first few minutes of fighting on the snow  i was thinking  enough already  i get it  samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces   watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment
__label__0 this is my third digital camera  i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water  i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports  after a few months of ok pictures  the macro setting is not very good though  the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it  i would manually open up the lens cover each time  then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that  but now the camera is almost completely dead  it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps  i m not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this  i will not buy another canon camera  this camera was made too cheaply  i wish things were not made to break right away
__label__1 this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film cater burwells score is a pitchperfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display  with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightlyalso an added bonus of the abovementioned dream combination bartok s  quot  allegroquot   i know diddly about classical music  but bartok rocks     and a typically great bjork songquot  amphibianquot   in two versions   that bookends the album with an etherial  dreamlike haze
__label__0 dull and uninspiring  listening to this cd i could nt see what distinguished the doves from the other insipid soundalike bands that plague the modern music scene  if you like the white stripes  franz ferdinand  arctic monkeys  the killers then be grateful that they ve saved rock music from boring dross like this
__label__0 this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny  it is filled with mediocre  funny  patters that the readers are encouraged to use  but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor  balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic  once you read a few samples  the reading becomes stifling  knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you  some areas are brighter  the photos are clear  and it blends magician bios and history within  but one can do better with other books around
__label__1 i just bought this thru best buy  could have got a better deal thru amazon  oh well  this product is amazing and very user friendly  i really love the fact that it comes with its very own manual not a help guide you can print out yourself wasting all your paper  it does everything  the props are very realistic  the shapes  edges so cool  i have filled in very dark pictures using the watercolor feauture and made poor pictures look like works of art  not to mention that i can create my own photomontages  collages   very unique artistic scrapbook pages  it took me an hour to scrapbook an amazing page including fixing up photos  i will never spend money on scrapbook pages again  so much fun

__label__0 let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy  after reading this book  i now think he is one step above slime  to be fair  some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing  he is antipc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie odonnell  michael moore  barney frank  barbara streisand  and  that fat girl from the dixie chicks   among others  no problem there in my opinion  that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book  the rest is just babble  often repeated over and over again  that even larry lovers will find annoying  a couple things that really bothered me  the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of  retards  and down s syndrome children  he must use the term  retard  at least fifty times in the book  this is appreciably different than making a joke about  say  michael moore  moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes  the down s syndrome children did not  my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on  retards   he also racially sterotypes in the book  many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond  the down s syndrome kids cant  larry  i can only hope god  in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book  grants you a  retard  child to love and care for  then  i would like to read your next book  i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly  the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses  he plays the good  ol bubba  he ai nt too bright and he ai nt ever changed since he left the farm  his  celebrity   his word not mine  has not gone to his head  ok  larry  why then the better than thou tone throughout the book  including speeches and lectures  including serious topics such as abortion  why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down  why the unrelenting references to your  celebrity   the terms  meet and greet  and  afterparty  were used over and over and over  as an example  do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are  well  you are wrong  they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become  that s hollywoodspeak my country  fart loving  nose picking friend  overall  this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron  see does nt that sound better than  retard    my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people  those who are dumb and know they are dumb  and those who are dumb but are so dumb  they do nt realize it  the former category usually shuts up  knowing they are dumb   the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter  the first group is obviously smarter than the second  larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group  the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book  make jokes  larry  and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like  unfortunately  larry ca nt see the obvious  like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book  he has become exactly one of them  a thin layer of  good  ol boy  on top  covering a core of venom and  celebrity   he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets  my suggestion  do nt buy larry s act and  by all means  do nt buy the book

__label__0 i bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips  i simultaneously had bloodwork at the doctor s office when i did the test  except for the total cholesterol  all the other tests were off  the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done  except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color  the test strips which are expensive were bad  i am planning on returning this produc
__label__1 great product  i found it to be very easy to use and hassle free
__label__0 the camera case only works if you wear a belt  there is no clip on  the case itself holds only the camera  not even space for a spare battery or memory card   i ve heard the case will darken your camera  but i did nt end up using the case   the neck strap is not useful  it s too long  at   inches  if you re not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it   the canon camera rocks  however

__label__1 this program does what it says  it does limit you to only  loadings of the product on your computer  so if you have more than  computers you have to buy another program
__label__0 this book should get  stars  speaking as an artist myself  the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous  the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics  etc to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master  and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse  admittedly  i could not even finish this book  after reading for the nth time a line of shaky  circumstantial evidence like  all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw  but there are no correction marks  therefore optics must have been used   i could not even stand to keep reading  on the contrary  all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult  after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature  and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction  that is just one example  the book is filled with flaky examples such as those  hockney claiming  this is too good to have been done without optics  or  this was too difficult to have been done without optics   and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art  if that is indeed what he thinks  and  modern artists must remember this  nowadays  the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists  for many reasons  superior art education is very hard to find  and there are many distractions in the modern world  tv  computers  having to hold a  day job   lack of patrons  etc  and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did  therefore  most will never attain the skill of the old masters  but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology  some of the other examples used as  evidence  refer to  odd  proportion  perspective  etc in otherwise masterful work  i am surprised that this author  and those readers who are artists  apparently does not realize that throughout history  great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism  even nowadays  photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists  because after all we are artists not cameras  the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality  not to copy it  therefore  many inconsistencies in proportion  perspective  etc evident in old masters  work are not  oddities  or  mistakes   but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition  all that being said  i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist  since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of  trickery  or technology of some sort  instead  an art student should be encouraged to build skill  discipline  and selfreliance  because that is the true secret of the great masters
__label__0 i use turbotax every year and i would efile also  it says i can efile for  and it even says that s all it will cost on one of the last windows  then right before it is about to transmit it says  for federal plus  for state plus  percent what i owe to some  third party  company  thats  for each    you owe  if i m paying some third company to transmit my return than why am i paying turbotax to do it also  so ok i ll print it out and send it in  it wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of  pages  it no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need  i am now cornered into paying the extra  to efile or go through the torture of printing out  pages in which i need only  or  dirty trick  it makes the total cost  it would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant  other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before
__label__1 heats up quickly  tends to dry out more than previous chi flat iron i had  much more economical
__label__1 i m a bit surprised by the negative reviews  this cd is amazing  it s not anything like soundgarden or audioslave  but it s amazing nonetheless  every song on here is beautifully written  and  as always  cornell s voice does nt disappoint  it s different  but one of my new favorite cds
__label__0 bought this case along with a digital rebel xti  my first slr  instead of the mm kit lens i opted for the sigma mm lens  sad to say  but the case fits only with the kit lens  the rebel xti with the mm lens barely fits  so a word of cuation to everyone  if you re planning on anything other than the kit lens  then do nt get this
__label__1 when one begins to despair about the quality  or lack thereof  of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being  not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over  pages one that i finished all too quickly  i could not get enough of it  the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly  his employer  a lord darlington  is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans  and what did mr stevens think of this  he did nt  he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate  there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr stevens  you ll have to read the book if you want to know more  i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not  if you get this book you will not be sorry
__label__0 this book was as much the author s opinion and imagination as anything else  he makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts  biblical or otherwise  i will not purchase further books by this author
__label__0 i bought this book and was sorely disappointed  nothing specific  just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do  you could do this yourself without a book
__label__0 the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct  the description of this product is a misnomer  the heating pad never heats up  and takes forever to just warm up  on a scale of  to   i would rate it a zero  do nt waste your money on this  i will be returning mine
__label__1 this movie was both entertaining and at times  hilarious  charlie sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist  denise richards is funny as his ditzy  shallow girlfriend and angie harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper  also  jon lovitz is hysterical as sheen s plastic surgeon best friend  this movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor  i highly recommend it
__label__0 the title of this product is a joke  it should be called  not easy cd burning   roxio version  was much easier than this one is  it is way too complicated for burning simple cds
__label__0 if you like early priest  buy genocide  it has both rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny in their entirety  the only thing it does not have is the original album artwork   not leaving out important tracks like the ripper  for pete s sake    how could you leave out the ripper  and what about island of domination  i feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with priest  they got jipped and did nt even know it  these are my favorite albums by priest and i hate to see them butchered like this  and what about the order of the songs  why would they mess with that too  do youself a favor and buy either genocide  or if you like to have the original artwork  buy rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny seperately
__label__1 i am so happy with this product  i have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach  if i eat too late at night or eat the  wrong  thing  i just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night
__label__1 i am pleased with the purchase  very good value  picture quality is good and it is easy to operate  only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic  however  it looks good  this is my second purchase of this product  one for myself and one as a gift
__label__1 this is a good compilation of afi s songs over the  years they ve been together  it s easily worthy of  stars  this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow  and to get more intimate with the band  i hav nt purchased this album yet  because i already have all their albums  but plan on it  the new tracks are from the answer that  and very proud of ya era  they ve finally been released on cd  this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also  anyway  buy this album only if you hav nt heard any of afis music but want to give it a try
__label__0 like many other negative reviews  i ve experienced the same problems with this razor  i guess less blades is more and i m going back to the m power  i ll be brief about the problems   there s more  pulling  when you shave  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut   the razor is harder to clean off   i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn   it s more expensive than other better razors out there  so there you have it  if you have to try it out  hey it might work for you  but please  keep your receipt  and packaging  in case you want to get a refund  if you re reading this is   chances are that gillette s money back guarantee will no longer be around  however  there will probably be a gillette razor with  blades by then
__label__1 when the etxpe works  it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into  let me elaborate  first  the best telescope is the one you use most often  all too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry  and that need frequent adjustment  the little etx weighs less than  lbs all set up  including tripod   and never needs adjustment  it encourages frequent use  second  one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy  especially for the newcomer  is finding objects to look at  if you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located  it can get very frustrating spending up to  minutes just to find one object to look at  the etx s built in computer makes finding objects easy  just select what you want to see from a menu  and the scope will automatically point to it  the optical quality of the etx is excellent  the manufacturer  meade  does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best  some of the most rewarding objects  the moon  jupiter  saturn  and the orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope  one final positive to mention is the ease of setup  the pe models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running  just turn on the power  press one key on the hand held computer controller  and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you  you do nt need to worry about where north is  or what the current date  time  and location are  now some cautions  first  the etx is a small telescope  and will not show as much as a larger one  that is the tradeoff with getting a portable instrument  there are larger etx models that are almost as portable  so these might be a consideration  also  understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer  it s not hard  but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure  finally  be prepared for some quality control issues  as good as the optics are  some etx s have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair  my own etxpe had to go back to the factory twice  but once all the problems were fixed  it was well worth it  on this note  you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price  and i would recommend doing so
__label__0 when i got this camera for my birthday april  i thought that it was a dream come true  the picture quality was brilliant  it was easy to use  the device was ment to be envied  it took marvelous pictures until within  months  july   the lcd screen cracked  the camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage  i was never suspiscious of it until i took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems  something bad will happen to this camera  either the sceen will break or the memory card thing  a friend of mine also owned the s  and her screen broke before mine did  the camera still takes photos  but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options  it is not worth the price of repair  tomorrow i am going to buy a new camera
__label__0 i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security  now i regret buying one  since ive installed it  it slowed my computer  its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off  everytime im on the internet  i get mad and upset  its not worth all the stress  i definitely dont recommend this product  now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton
__label__1 it was everything it was reported to be  it works very well  we take it on every trip we take
__label__0 listening to the standards being sung by rod stewart is like listening to classical music being played on a kazoo  if you re new to this music  try out some sinatra cds  he s the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the standards
__label__0 i sorta of agree with the person below  this album sucksplain and simple  however i think he is still doing a great job in rhapsody  i gave it one star not so much because it is garbage  but becuase i was looking forward to this album since  prophets of the last eclipse  which was great  but trullyi do nt know went wrong  i do nt have a problem with female vocalists  but in this albumit is retched  i do nt think i will ever listen to this album ever again  sorry  but its truedo not buy this album  pretend you never knew he had a new albumoh  and do not buy luca turilli s dreamquest either  another bomb
__label__1 hounds is an outstanding piece of work  two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly  the first consisting of five individual songs  though all with a very similar feel and texture  the second is a conceptual set of songs called the ninth wave  which has had many meanings read into it  all five tracks from the first piece are excellent  the opening track  running up that hill  is possibly kate s greatest single of all time  up there with wuthering heights and babooshka   it is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics  it has been reworked by aussie outfit infusion in recent years and become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of john digweed and dj tiesto  it had lost none of it s appeal or sense of urgency over time  the title track is a beautiful  upbeat song  again it has made a resurgence in the last year  thanks to modrock uk band the futureheads  the big sky is my favourite  you want my reply  what was the question  i was looking at the big sky    the extended mix is great and available on the  emi remastered release of hounds  mother stands for comfort is a little out of place  dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on the dreaming  kates vocals are  in my opinion  sublime on this track  the fantastic song  cloudbusting  nearly deserves a review on it s own  a masterpiece in modern pop  it tells one of the best stories i ve ever heard in a pop song  and combines it with one of the best video clips i ve ever seen  the ninth wave is beyond review  you need to buy this lp and listen to it over and over again  it will mean different things to different people  and i think that is what makes it so amazing  commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning  i have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life  but each ends happily  the whimsical the morning fog makes sure of it  else  just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape  read nothing into it and take the ninth wave for a musical ride  that s my favourite way to listen to it  finally  if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment  say the  amplifier you re about to splurge on  take the remastered lp as your test  the percussion should be clear  the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise  an outstanding lp in every way
__label__0 if you have read harmon s acting resume online  then you know she has talent  she has the training  and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along  but being a mild conservative  angie is a republican  in liberal hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at  good advice was bad advice for her  it is miscast with two annoying stars  sheen and richardsand some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie  it has no redeaming values at all and angie deserves better roles then this  this movie was made by artiscan films  which recently went into bankruptcy and is now lions gate films  their films are still bad no matter the name change  and i still wait to see a better movie come to angie harmon
__label__0 i bought this to play back old hi tapes so i could transfer them to dvd  however  there is no svideo out and no stereo out  video quality was bad  output was noisey and reds were over saturated  i imagine this is because there is no svideo out  i returned it and have ordered a sony gvd hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much  there are some cheaper used options available  eg sony evo
__label__0 this series represents the second attempt to revive tz  and is vastly inferior to its predecessor  the series began with some builtin problems  particularly the choice of forest whitaker as hostnarrator  mr whitaker is a fine actor  but a poor choice to host the series  and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes  often walking around while delivering his opening lines  after watching some of these episodes  one can understand forest s discomfort  he probably regretted accepting the job  another major problem is that this series came out on upn  which has never been  and never will be  a leader in quality programming  although there are some interesting story ideas  they usually fall flat in the end   it s still a good life  is a noteworthy example  intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series  and featuring original cast members cloris leachman and bill mumy  with the addition of mumy s daughter  liliana   this episode gets off to a good start  but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn  leading to a rushed  nonsensical  and unsatisfying conclusion  this sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series  talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing  this series resembles the original in name only  and even the worst of the mid s episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly  poorlywritten  lame stories  the kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged  enjoy it for what it is  but  as andy taylor once told gomer pyle   do nt overexpect
__label__1 how families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this starladen  movie  but stage and tv director jerry zaks  screenwriter scott mcpherson  and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant  based on a play by mcpherson before he succumbed to aids  the semiautobiographical plot focuses on two estranged  middleaged sisters  in florida  mousey spinster bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father marvin and their eccentric aunt ruth  in ohio  lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in ohio only to see things fall apart  lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to lee and her sons as potential bonemarrow transplant candidates  the rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable  intriguingly  while the soap opera elements are strictly bythenumbers  there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece  it also helps that meryl streep and diane keaton play the sisters  as the embittered  guiltridden lee  streep moves easily back into bluecollar  silkwood territory  and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her selfcentered character  however  it s a vanityfree keaton who really radiates as bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances  a year before  titanic   leonardo di caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as lee s oldest son hank  a textbook example of teenaged  pyromaniac angst  the rest of the cast is fine in limited turns  robert deniro  one of the producers as well  as the bumbling dr wally  dan hedaya as his even more pixilated brother bob  gwen verdon as wildeyed  soap operaobsessed aunt ruth  hal scardino as hank s selfcontrolled little brother charlie  and hume cronyn  who is forced to play marvin with severely limited expression  there are predictable moments throughout  but some surprise and a few actually enthrall  including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when bessie recalls the drowning death of her openmouthed carny boyfriend  there are no extras with the  dvd release
__label__0 i found this title messing around adding things to my wish list  i only read the blurb on amazon enough to see haitian creaole listed as one of the languages  today updating my wish list i took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is  stars or more  how unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake i almost made buying this in hopes of it having haitian creole  very disappointing     the makers should be ashamed
__label__0 purchased this machine for my wife  born   who has high blood pressure     untreated  and typeii diabetes  had high hopes as this was not a drugrelated therapy  but was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results  yes  she enjoyed using it  but her blood pressure was not improved  here is my analysis for your consideration  if your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life  resperate may work for you  but there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis  so  carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying
__label__1 aside form the fact that canon charges an arm and a leg for a  dollar piece of plastic  the remote switch does work well  it does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the canon cameras  people with big hands may have a little trouble using this product  overall  a  must have  addition for anyone interested in long exposures  images with excellent sharpness and depth of field
__label__0 i have several dummies books  from how to build a pc to ccna  i had to read this rediculous book when i worked for a very well known dsl provider on the east coast  this book was trivial  assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly  yes  i agree  hot bot is a pretty good search enginebut it is not the only one out there  this book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement  easily the worst dummies book in print  and im not being a jerk  i love dummies books  ron gilster rocks  but this is absolute crap  you can honestly get more informed with a magazine
__label__1 useful easy to use good price i would recommend this product
__label__1 these shows do nt date  they are as fresh as they were over  years ago  these shows deserved all the emmys they received  a mustsee series  i m glad they are finally releasing them  i would prefer more extra features though  more show commentary would be nice as well
__label__0 die hard fans of writerdirector david cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this scifi horror tale  that accounts for so many  star ratings by other reviewers  that was not my reaction to this film  it was slow  uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment  i give it only  stars  the characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are  gamers  duh  cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film  he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles  william defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant  jennifer jason leigh s wardrobe looks like retros  jude law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes  beware of the tag line that says existenz  makes the matrix look like child s play   this film is no where near the caliber of the matrix  if you are not a cronenberg fan  i recommend that you pass on this dull film
__label__0 many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third  but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long  is so boring and offers not variety at all  this program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals  and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own  it does not contain essential grammar instruction  it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages  french is not a translation of english  or spanish  or any other language   grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own  this program claims to help you learn  naturally  but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar  culture  conversational structures  and clear understanding  not natural  for adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts  adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children  sometimes even faster  i do not believe that  learning a second language like a child  is an accurate statement to describe this program  children are immersed in the culture  everything around them is the  real deal   not repetitious pictures and recordings  children receive verbal and nonverbal input constantly  and adults have greater cognition than children do  looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means  but there is not accuracy  it is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand  rosetta stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences  but i could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated  and overpriced program
__label__1 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland  just like their other fellow ohion s devo  the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different wayi have owned this recording in various formats since  and i have never grown tired of this album  i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over  years ago  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and rerecord it  it just wouldnt happen  there is just a certain magic that they captured in   as to the music itself i tend to break  up this album into  distinct parts  side one being the more accessible  drunken  side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise  but a little too intelligent  just listen to the lyricsside  is definately the  drug  side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland  i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric  and the rest of the band help to reinforce this craziness by going off in a million different directionsi could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize  experience and consume at your own leisure  and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you  so if you loved things like throbbing gristle s song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu s album the mordern danceas another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guysi also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a fewso if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in  then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album  even if you have to beg  steal or borrow it

__label__1 i used to listen to a friend s copy of the original  metal box  of ep s  when it first came out  years later the  second edition  came out on lp s for those of us who had nt sprung for the metal box before it sold out  eventually the second edition came out on this cd  so i finally could own a digital copy myself  pristine  audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion  if i remember correctly  you do need to listen to this  you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too

__label__0 i purchased partition magic  based on my previous experience with symantec virus protection and firewall products  i am sorry that i did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by symantec for other products that i have purchased from them  all i wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my c  drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive  i was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with symantec technical support  i was only able to speak to technical support staff in india who finally told me that they could not solve my problem  but that i would be called back by a senior engineer  it never happened despite repeated promises  i finally gave up and returned the product to symantec for a refund
__label__0 i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely  the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the axx series  my adapter arrived and it does nt work with my camera  kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately  bummer  also  captain jack is correct about the vignetting  this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the builtin zoom lens  if you zoom wide angle  you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned  if you stay zoomed in  it works ok  disappointing
__label__1 this is an all around awesome product  i have had great experiences with the program  and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school s yearbook  anyone one who says it does nt have the basics is pretty much lying to you  it has anything you ll ever need and more  the people who review this product poorly do so because they do nt know how to use everything in it  the only problem i ve ever had is learing everything you can do with it  otherwise it is perfect
__label__1 abobe hits one out of the park  i find adobe software clunky and hard to use  while i understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but photoshop and indesign have learning curves that are steeper than mount everest  i expected lightroom to be the same  an excellent program with a huge learning curve  well it is and it is nt which it why lightroom is such a pleasure to use  i do nt know what adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses  for they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing  the program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable  lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality  the strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an ok photo into an amazing one  if you do anything with photographs buy this program  you wo nt regret it
__label__1 the product has very good themes and screen savers  some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future
__label__0 this will be the third time i have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album  and i suppose i have been too harsh  because neither of my previous efforts have been posted  lets keep this one simple  this is not music  plain and simple  i purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site  and was terribly disappointed  it basically consists of massively distorted  and detuned  guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence  structure  or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument  call it performance art  experimental noise  whatever  it s simply not music
__label__0 the product features are ok  but the screen is very small  also  the resolution needs to be better  the photos were very grainy  an impressive looking product with not so impressive output
__label__0 the burning  was a big letdown after reading bentley little s masterful book   dispatch   i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and could nt write  who knows  i love this guy and ca nt tell you how disappointed i was  while one of the top  horror writers working today  bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories  i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release  it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick  and  with everything he was trying to do  none of it  not one moment  was scary  shadow creatures performing random oral sex  creeping fungus  talking voices in the microwave  deformed goblins peering in windows  skeletons climbing out of mud pits  tunnels filled with moving corpses  and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly  it reminded me of his previous work   the return   another disappointment containing silly  bizarre  and unrealistic situations  the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value  suspense  and atmospheric quality  the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story  one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day  bentley needs to do what he does best  which is to come up with a gimmick  focus everything on that single idea  and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling  it worked with  the store    the association    the policy   and  dispatch   just to name a few  let s hope he gets back on track with his next book
__label__0 in the chapter about south asia  the authors have written quite a lot about the  quot  kashmir problemquot  but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of    kashmiri hindus that took place in  i just cannot believe that they do nt know about this

__label__0 this keychain photo viewer sold by a company called  smartparts  is identical to one sold by  argus   neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support  you buy this  you re on your own  you seem to be able to find the argus one a little cheaper  though they do mar the front of it with a big  black imprint of their logo  in any case  this thing is maybe worth  as a novelty  do nt pay more  image quality is mediocre and the software  while functional  is stunningly primitive  if you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations  it s a kind of cute gizmo  but do nt give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy  check the bargain bins for this thing  or just wait for the next generation device    m

__label__0 after reading this book  it was apparent to me that the author was implying that nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged  mcginnis boasts of nixon and his pr teams ability to hide the  quot  truequot  nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image  he proclaims that the real nixon was the one that the country saw debating kennedy on tv in  nothing could be further from the truth  first off  nixon won the  election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation  all historians admit that jfk had help from daily in illinois and lbj in texas  furthermore  in the  debates  nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and jfk s staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat  if anyone decieved the voters with his image  it was jfk using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and jfk the family man and the idealist  jfk exploited the missile gap  had numerous affairs  assassinated ngo dihn diem  wire tapped martin luther king  screwed up the bay of pigs  and had ties to the mafia  now  i could be wrong  but jfk s campaign sounds like a true selling of the president   selling of the president  has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays left wing propaganda of the s
__label__0 this one is for you  but honestly now  the guy does nt write beautiful voice but songwriting is a major appeal  so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake  ok  there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork   what a  wonderful world  but generally this a very casual compilation  good for a couple listens  in general  art garfunkel is nt really good for more than that  check out him witht paul simon  that is amazing stuff  but this is kinda boring  i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs but even though there are good songwriters writing for him  the songs are still subpar
__label__0 i just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation  in this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round  that song is not listed on the song track and i think it should be  the song is atrevido by orishas  i think this is wrong
__label__0 the unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes dan brown look like borges in comparison  naming characters  guard one  just shows you do nt even try to care  the plot is so hairbrained that just thinking about it gives me a headache   i just learned  to my horror  that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times  i d have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise  but it s been ruined forever by  this  somewhere  baby jesus is crying
__label__1 this parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come  it has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it  it is by far  in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo  i give this bold majesty of the monarchy  the  il duce   five stars
__label__0 i only got about  hours of run time per charge out of this battery so i returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me  hours of run time per charge
__label__0 the bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things do nt go as planned  customer service exists but their reps claim they ca nt do anything about your problem  their manners are less than acceptable  rude seems to be the  inthing  at this company  as consumers  we have options  one of which is to ge elsewhere  i am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned  it s too bad
__label__0 i assumed  incorrectly  that adobe s customer service would be professional and quick  i have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait  at a minimum   minutes just to speak to someone  when i finally got my product  they sent the mac verion rather than the pc version i purchased  i called again and waited approximately  minutes to get customer help  i had originally ordered the pc standard version and asked to upgrade  and pay difference  for the professional version   since i still had nt received the pc version  customer service stated that they would only ship me the standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped mac version and then i would have to wait for the standard verison to arrive at which point i could call again  and ask to exchange for the professional verion  insane    adobe s call center is easily the worst customer service i have dealt with   and i ve dealt with some bad customer service

__label__1 for anyone on the fence about these  jump over to my side   my  then   year old had gotten a hold of my husband s permanent black marker  we just bought a brand new refrigerator  i turned my back for a few moments  and when i looked back  she had scribbled all over my new fridge  i tried bleach  soap  scrubby sponges  nothing worked  my first new appliance was ruined  on a whim i bought this   could nt hurt  right   it got it off immediately   i had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves   i was so excited  i started running around my house trying to find things to scrub  i know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease  markers or crayons from walls  and a multitude of other  sins  your children may commit against your home
__label__0 i had high hopes for this cd  i love norwegian metal  and i love viking stuff so i thought this would be great  i was at least hoping it would be good  what i heard was a bunch of uninspired  mediocre  a dime a dozen metal songs  i mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste  but not enough to give it even  stars  the high points are the fate of norns  the persuit of vikings  and arson  these songs are bad  and fun to listen too  an ancient sign of coming storm  just mediocre where death seems to dwell  very repetitive the fate of norns  this one is pretty good  it has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it  the pursuit of vikings  this is my favorite song from this cd  pretty bad a valkyries ride  tedious monotony the beheading of a king  same as valkryies arson  a bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar once sealed in blood  a bit faster than some but still a downer  all in all nothing horrible  and there is some good songs  the music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad  i like a lot of simpler music like darkthrone and burzum  the problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff i like it to have some really good aptmosphere  that is precisly what is lacking here  i will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow

__label__1 i do nt own this cd  i do nt have to own it to review it  because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years  i lived this music  i listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in  er  various activities  half of the bands on this cd i had the privilege of seeing perform live in the s  this is what fm radio sounded like back then  every single song on this cd was well known to me and my friends  yes  even black oak arkansas  hot and nasty    nazareth  get hair of the dog cd for more   and the runaways  hot babes    oh  and i love the movie too  party on  dudes
__label__1 excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives  you can format  partition  split  merge and a whole lot of other things  if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software  with both  you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c  drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another  this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup   note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive   thats why i recommend both acronis software packages

__label__0 with much anticipation we awaited the arrival of clay s second album  thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers  and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career  while clay s voice still sounds great  the cd is an entire collection of uninspired  underproduced remakes  not one of which goes beyond the original  as you can see  this cd is nowhere on the billboard charts  and we re very sad to say in our household  that it s for good reason  save your money and buy one of the much better idol cds  and almost any of them are  most recently kelly pickler and carrie underwood
__label__0 i ordered this dvd series because i liked kristy alleys performance in other movies and series  but this is totally different  a lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted  after viewing two episodes i put it in the trash  watching this does not make me happy
__label__1 i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end  i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck  once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills  lastly  you have to hit the  f  keys and  esc  to save and exit the game  not many program make you do that today  overall  i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given  stars if functionally was better with program
__label__0 this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it   pour out all the water   the filter comes crashing out  it s topheavy  i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge  it may be clumsy to refill   which is why i thought i d try a pitcher   but it s extremely easy to use
__label__1 i have three types of headlamps and i like this one the most  here is why    it s cheap    it runs a long time on three aaa batteries  and   the red light is awesome  you can use the red light and still keep your  night vision   i use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light  my only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing  even after two years of use  i often have to twist twice to get the right setting  and i m usually good at that stuff
__label__0 i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest  however  i was in so much pain about  hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil  i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help  but nothing seemed to work  the taste is nt bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist  so it did nt leak out or touch my gums  my teeth were nt sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards  but later in the day  if you have sensitive teeth  i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain
__label__0 i am a huge fan of olay products and use their foaming face wash  moisturizers  including the regenerist continuous night recovery is a great product   so i was really dissapointed to spend  on this product and then see no change  i am in my  s  have fair  medium shade combination skin  i tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a breakout spot that was healing  i tried using it a couple of times a day  at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while i slept  not blending it into my skin   i tried it for several weeks  no results  this product did nothing for me  i would not recommend it  i would have given it zero start  but amazon does not allow it  avon has a product out that touts similar claims to olay s product  i have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an avon rep  instead
__label__1 this is another superbly done documentary from the award winning pbs investigative journalism series frontline  peabody award  emmy and many more    disregard what one reviewer said about this being prowalmart propaganda paid for by the corporation  he s obviously smoking something  because this is made and hosted by hedrick smith  a pulitzer prize winning journalist who used to write for the ny times  he is one of america s most respected journalists  i started watching the show since i was in high school  i m now late  s  and their shows are exceptionally high quality  now  if frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by walmart  how is this prowalmart  the story starts in america and its impact on the us economy  he interviews some professors  economists  managers  suppliers  and executives  then the story moves to china and hk  and then back to the us  there are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in american culture and business history  is walmart good for america  i ca nt answer that and neither can frontline  this documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle  it asks some thought provoking questions  the us trade deficit is getting worse every day  quality is going up  some  made in china  stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year   and that s really scary for us in america  who s the blame  well  all of us  we re not competing well in the global economy  and we want the cheapest goods  we re not willing to put our money where our mouth is  if you re interested in economics  history  social issues  this is a must see  if you care about the american economy  and global events  you should watch this documentary  it s loads better than the  walmart  the high cost of low prices  film  which is very one sided and not nearly as well done   oh   and start learning chinese
__label__0 to get hot lather  which is nice  you first have to get the device installed on top the can  i would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated  the directions provided are sparse in several languages  first you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream  they provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others  then you have to fit the device on top the can  it worked well with one brand in a large size can  when i tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process  using a different brand in a large can  i had trouble prying the top off the can  if you have time and patience  and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well  give it a try  otherwise  be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language  it would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the us  apparently manufactured somewhere in asia  would provide a clear set of instuctions in english  in reasonable large readable type  with illustrations  in this case  they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for  i do not need instructions in foreign languages  and get tired of limited instructions in six languages
__label__0 does anyone know if there is a real pg version of this film  i ve been told it came out as a pg and then was changed to an r film  pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see

__label__0 yeah  i know it s the industry standard  and it s powerful  and all that stuff  but  my god  what a freaking pain to use  it s just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch  while the interface in cs is an improvement  doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should  frankly  i could draw better stuff faster with s era macintosh drawing programs  the drawing issues are compounded by the fact that   in true adobe spirit   this program is incredibly bloated and slow  it s slow doing everything  i ve never seen a program so slow starting up  and every time you save a file  even a tiny drawing with  shapes  you get a  saving file  progress bar for a few seconds  it s also incredibly slow to shut down  frequently taking about  seconds  i m running it on a pentium m laptop  and i know this is not a  graphics professional  machine  but come on  let s get the lead out  i just get the sense that adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed  that bugs me a lot
__label__0 it s only redeemingly quality is the price  if you get a good deal   photo quality is poor  and screen is quite small  x   navigation is not overly complicated  but buttons must be pushed hard to work  it did work perfectly fine  took sd card  even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame  but  because of the poor quality of the photos  i do nt suggest buying
__label__1 after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed  but it s been over  months and so far so good  i sleep on it every night   i m buying a real bed when i move in june  and it is holding up
__label__1 had the  f   and loved it to pieces with a d  and now with a d mkii  but sold the  in order to pay for a   which is my work horse  due to the push and pull feature however  the  gets dusty quick in good ol  montana land  so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while  and the f  stop is nt always desirable for certain situations  the  f   is amazing  the twist zoom is a little close to the camera  so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it  and imho  is a bit too much of a turn to be from  to  in the time one might need for extreme sports   rodeo  nascar etc  the clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away  i did a comparison of images from my  f   when it was new  and the  is still visibly sharper  i put an expensive filter on it  as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions  and i do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter  even though it is a good bw  so when i can  i shoot the lens with no filter if i require extreme detail  the l is nowhere near the quality of this little  if it were nt for the difference in distance  this lens would be my one and only  oh  and i love the is  as it is my first is lens  i treasure is  but know i will not buy another distance lens without it
__label__0 this is probably the worst war related movie i ve ever seen  i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two  time spent watching this film is time you ll never get back and have nothing to show for it
__label__0 the story line was fair  but the ta not so hot   star
__label__1 i was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this mm to be an excellent first choice  i love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do  however  the autofocus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes  i ve found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster  at least in low light
__label__1 less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor   in like flint  still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films  the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world  this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world s women while replacing powerful males with surgicallyaltered substitutes  leading to  perhaps  the most prescient line of dialogue in any s film upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be  a disbelieving flint says   an actor as president     that is  until a renegade zowie general  steve inhat  decides it s his turn to take the reins of power  the delightful lee j  cobb is back as flint s curmudgeonly boss  cramden  as are the secret agent s posse of female admirers  and tv s batgirl  yvonne craig  even shows up as a russian ballerina   in like flint  feels more grown up than the previous film  partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody  notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind and charging a premium for them are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows  crossdressing  and the bouncing singalong ball  only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment  as it s a staple of the genre  meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort  a nofrills dvd
__label__1 this album is simply one of the coolest things around  and when i listened to it  it inspired me to a similar project using the same  weaving and zoning from place to place  kind of method  what this basically is  are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly indian  middle eastern  oriental festivals  they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice  you get indian gamelan  mussette accordion  vocal choruses  foreign tongue talking  and psychadelic bagpipes all in one  minute track  and then some  it s very trippy  and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason  get this for your own good
__label__0 this is first canon product that has disappointed me with its quality  they must acquire them from their chinese supplier for about  cents  this plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position  i bought it to use with the canon d closeup lens and it s barely adequate for that function  canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks
__label__1 this has helped me more than i can say  it has helped with a death of a very close relative  without this i would nt be able to lead a normal day at my high level stress job
__label__0 i admit that i m far from an expert on digital cameras  i did take over    photographs with mm cameras for over  years  i purchased a  powershot in july of  it was nt too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would nt work  i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them  i can understand them saying   we ll charge you at first  but once we establish that the fault is due to us  we ll then reimburse you back   i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera  in the mail  and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back   i also emailed them the same request   neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon s behalf  that in itself was enough for me and i ve been bitter about that ever since  i ve also told every person that i ve met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident  i m pleased to say  i ve steered most away from this company  what else can i say about this camera  this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture  i ve missed out on some good shots due to this  it eats batteries like there s no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa s to even make this camera worth its while  i ve not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a  minute movie  with this camera  in my home during the day and go outside  most things outside are very white  almost like looking at an infra red photograph  when filming outside  when one goes inside during the day  everything is dark  like i said  maybe all digital cameras are this way  i would nt recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion  think about that  you have to pay the shipping for a camera that s barely a few months old and still under warranty  that s disgusting  that s all i have to say  there should be a zero for this  not a  star
__label__0 it s kind of bulky for a diaper bag  which is why i got it  the clippers are not good quality  the thermometer is cheap  it has a little  f  for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading  the  f  is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming week old  it also takes a while to read
__label__0 i never could understand why the beatles are so popular  they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd  each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about  seconds  i just dont like it because it sucks  dont listen to the moronic  star reviewers below  the beatles only made one good album and that s the one which contains ballad of john and yoko  hey jude
__label__1 i m a vain   year old male and started using this product  in combination with another highly regarded antiwrinkle product  about three months ago  this daily application replaced a daily application of facial conditioner  moisturizer  i was hoping some barely noticable forehead wrinkles would go away  no such luck  i notice a definite reduction in wrinkle depth in the morning  before i shower  but by midday  the wrinkles have returned to their normal state  does this really work   i suppose the only way to truly find out if this stuff works is to use it on only half the face and see the effect over time  in all fairness  i must mention that my face now routinely feels softer and smoother and less oily than before  that s why i rated this product a four instead of a three  but the frickin  wrinkles are still there  let me see all that clinical research all these skin care experts are touting
__label__0 you get a view into  s white america  the only people of color in this book are a policeman  and a caricature  i do nt have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe  this is set in everyday life  and i think its best left on the bookshelf  it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair  not to mention various shades of skin colour  the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this onedimensional  quot  whitequot  depiction of the world
__label__0 i do nt consider myself a hardocre  cent fan  but i went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of xxl  it was nt all that entertaining  the documentary does nt really tell the people anything that we do nt already know  we ve seen all these videos before  but the video for  quot  heatquot  is straight wack  the street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny  the show in detroit is nt entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of  people on stage chanting the words right along with  while making it impossible to understand a word that s being said  the sessions  aol are straight pointless and why did we need an  mile dvd trailer  the dvd borders on corny  but the cd is nt that bad  these are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs  but i had not been able to find the  quot   mile road  g unit remix   quot  ever since i lost my underground cd  lloyd banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this cd  dvd release  if you re a young buck fan  you should know that he s nowhere to be found on this release  overall  the new breed is nt completely terrible  but it loses its novelty after one or two uses  the three songs on the cd are decent  but you probably have them already  i would only reccomend this to the die hard  cent  g unit fans
__label__0 this book was written so long ago  but has been rereleased with a new cover  it contains racist terms and old fashioned dialog  i wished i had been more aware and had bought a more updated history of new orleans
__label__0 the concept is cute  although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them  but the main problem is that they give you hat hair  compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head  regular glasses go in between the hairs  so everything fluffs out  if you never take off your reading glasses  have a buzz cut  are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head  but be careful of buns   the clic connect reader may be fine for you  otherwise  conventional glasses are a better bet
__label__0 this was not the entire version of the hbo special  i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd  if i had known it was nt the entire show i would nt have bought it
__label__1 these guys and this album rocks  just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head  does nt  demote  it to pop  props to the great use of two bass guitars  released amid the misery  grunge rock explosion of the early  s  this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again  this album is highly recommended  kill your television  grey cell green  cut up  throwing things  happy  and until you find out are just an awesome experience  if you can find the grey cell green single release  i highly recommend that for the track entitled  trust
__label__0 the first shave seemed good  but the second time did me in with the fusion  instead of just one nick  i managed around  or  nicks at once  but looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock  i got a merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor  the blades are a huge savings  merkur blades or feather double edge blades average  cents apiece  the feather blades are extremely sharp  the gillette sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry  a good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor  a badger hair shaving brush   some proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable  relaxing for me
__label__1 i really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake  both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line

__label__0 this book is pretty much useless if you re looking for info on how to build a dulcimer  only about  pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making  repair  the rest is a long winded history  bio of homer ledford  some of that is a bit interesting from an historical  cultural perspective  but the author beats it to death  homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer  the rest was the author s idea  dean kimball s book on dulcimer making is better  although still lacking in some areas  this book has no patterns or plans  few useful photos  and is weak in what instruction it does provide  there are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book
__label__1 i bought this book for my  and  year old to learn more about american history while we live abroad in europe  i was more than pleased when i began reading the stories and found that they love the book  from the lewis  clark expedition to pac man  the stories are interesting and succinct enough to hold my kids  interest
__label__0 most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this cd is missing lot of songs which define extreme  the implication that it is a  quot  best ofquot  and not a  quot  greatest hitsquot  should have included more from their selftitled album  tsktsk  this does nt include  quot  mutha  do nt wanna go to school today   quot   how can that be
__label__0 ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality  to her there is no middle ground  i am an educated  well travelled adult who while born in the united states  spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded  to be called a communist  a traitor  and an enemy of america just because i do nt buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on  i have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it s evil  until i read this one  be afraid  be very afraid of these people

__label__0 this film  like most of his early work  is for hitchcock aficionados only  i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films  but i still found this movie tough going  not least because of the  mins running time  the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect  but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you d expect for the price  the musical score is also okay  but nothing to write home about  laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of  this dvd has no commentary  no documentary and no trailer  not even one of those awful tony curtis intros  so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a  special edition
__label__1 i was a little skeptical about this program  until i tried it last evening for the first time  i am really impressed  i did not even use the tutorial before i dove in and tried to play a bit  i created a single room in less than  minutes  using simple walls  doors  windows  and a fireplace  adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful  lol i am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities  today i watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do  i am entering into an interior design program in january  and wanted to  play  with the cad software in advance  i was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the better homes and gardens version as the idea of cad seemed intimidating  not any more  i wholeheartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any cad programs

__label__1 this is a great pda bible for many reasons  several of which are already mentioned in other reviews  it is easy to use  has most of the niv study bible notes and crossreferences  comes with a multi color highlighter  great for using different colors for different purposesred for commands  blue for promises  etc   you can change the font for easier reading  and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to  say  peace  that occured in the new testament  the programs that come with it are nice as well  including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the bible in one year  the ot in one year  the nt in one year  and many more options  i was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a handsdown  star program  though  the original niv study bible has elaborate introductions for each book  including author  purpose  structure  and much more  the palm version is lacking all of this  and has no introduction at all  the original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the bible  like a description of the differences between pharasees and sauducees  the palm version does not  the cross references are wonderful  click on a small circle after a verse  and all of the cross references pop up  simply click on a cross reference  and the program takes you right there  unfortunately  however  the palm program has no feature like a  back  button that gets you back to the original text  finding your original spot is not difficult  it only takes  seconds and a little concentration  but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it  finally  i would be actively marketing this product and the palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has  maps of the holyland  jerusalem  the middle east  the temple  and others that are in my paper niv study bible  despite these flaws  however  the program is a joy to use and i highly recommend it to all  i am using a tungsten t  the larger screen size make reading easier

__label__1 made in   douglas sirk s imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost  years ago  it s a real cinematic treat  shameless tearjerker  and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront headon issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one s teenagers  in this case daughters are growing up and preparing to enter the world  lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith  a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom  together with her young daughter susie  they live in a squalid apartment eking out a handtomouth existence  their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams  one day at coney island  lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane  who is being taken care of by a black woman  annie johnson  juanita moore   whom lora mistakes for the maid  when told by her that she s the mother  the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child  the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment  lora is initially hesitant  not because of annie s race but because she s struggling and does nt have any money to pay her a wage  eventually  however  she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night  at the same time  lora meets the extremely finelooking wannabe photographer  steve archer  john gavin   steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her  but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage  meanwhile  the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white  imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives  with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get  lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress  yet neglects her growing daughter in the process  steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization  but has trouble relating to lora s need to be independent and famous  annie s heart is eventually broken  gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter  sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away  annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid  whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success  the contrast of the mother s compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story s ultimate paradox  lora  annie  steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other  they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it does nt seem to be doing them much good  they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them  lora gets her career but she s unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother  whilst sara jane  perhaps the most damaged character  achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl  but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother  under douglas sirk s accomplished direction  miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately  everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life  especially lana s gorgeous outfits  yet the film  clocking in at over two hours  is always compelling and is never boring  the screenplay is sophisticated  the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film  the brilliant surfaces  audacious colors  and the spatial complexities of s moderne architecture  bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy  entrapment  and emotional anxiety  and where the price of following one s dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost  mike leonard june

__label__1 when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery  they said the one that came with it would only be good for about  minutes  now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime  a  min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good  business  choice  so i said no  so i got the camera  charged the battery until the light went green  which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it  and started taking pictures  oh i also got a g cf  worked greatso i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots  keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase  well      pictures  and  hours later the camera is still running strong  still have  shots left for the trip home  battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button  so all in all  i think the battery life is great  now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point  the original will work fine  as for the quality of photosi love them

__label__1 this is a good software for casual use  hiking  biking  geocaching   but not without issues  on the positive side  it definitely beats all nondigital  scanned usgs maps  alternatives  the level of details is good enough  how many of us need to know topography down to  feet    the fact that maps are digitally generated  with vectors i believe  makes all the labels clear at any scale  it has two advantages over its main  digital  competitor  ng topo  first  all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state  region cds from ng  and second  it is available  i could not even find ng s northeast edition anywhere on the web  one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations  now the few negatives  the exchange feature with gps is flaky  sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin  part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plugandplay even with comtousb adapter  beats me why garmin ca nt make all their gps with usb in this day and age   in any case  regardless of whose fault it is  it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly  the second problem i noticed was with the d window  it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling  i ended up just closing that window  since it is pretty much for  coolness  and does not add any real topographical value  finally  i had a problem with delorme s service  i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer  however  a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code  the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake  they requested that i send a correct one  but with the code cut out and gone  how do they expect me to come up with one   i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but  is not worth the time arguing with them over it  i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem

__label__0 this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time  it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of  action fantasy  as a number of hollywood films  examples of the rules of reality being abandoned  the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter  and the author even notes at one point how it s pitch dark outside  yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other  people spend minutes in freezing water  yet pop out none the worse for the wear  two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a  spaceship  has been found there  shouted once through the radio  a yearold girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically  nor  apparently  mentally  a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years  but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it  the stupidity goes on and on  but that s perhaps enough to give a taste  there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this  but i do nt enjoy books whose author does nt have one bit of interest in any sort of realism

__label__0 i was hoping that miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a classical epic  what we get is a blood splattered   lacedaimons in the hood   the spartans are presented to be a buch of homo erotic rastafarians  the persians rather than the noble middle eastern autocrats presented in their art are drawn by miller to resemble african american gangstas with piercings and skin art everywhere  i was looking for xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot  if you were into  sin city   you will love this mishmashed version of the classical tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds
__label__0 perhaps it s a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations  but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak  the singing is weak  and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music the songs are not all the same  but for some reason they all sound the same and embarrassingly  you can sing most of them after one listen  they are so simplistic and cliched

__label__0 i have to agree with the other reviews of this scope  i purchased this scope as a christmas gift  when i opened it  the equatorial mount  the basis for the entire scope  was broken  i contacted celestron and was promised another part for it  which never arrived  i contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me  it did nt fit  finally  i was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope  the equatorial mount was in  piece  yeah  too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and i could not assemble this one  i even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support  who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived  and all i got was a bunch of excuses  i finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one entire telescope  it s february and i just now have a product that works   i have nt had time to try it though   celestron offered no refunds for this telescope  so buyer beware  if they are not willing to satisfy customers  your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells  good luck

assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources  exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index  the book is divided into two  to fourpage sections  many of which are nearexact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site newsmaxcom  in january   savage published his second political book  the enemy within  saving america from the liberal assault on our schools  faith  and military  his newest book  liberalism is a mental disorder was released on april    both of these books contained citations of nearly every

neologisms   as of   savage has between  million and  million listeners per week  this makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the united states  in  he applied to be a dean at uc berkeley s graduate school of journalism  when he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications less than two years of experience in radio  with a phd  in epidemiology and nutrition science savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed  the position instead went to china scholar orville schell who  according to weiner  was less qualified than himself  savage was hired by msnbc to do a onehour show starting march    on july   a mere four months later  he was fired for making antigay remarks in response to a caller  later identified as prank caller  east coast bob   savage was doing an  airline horror stories  piece  when bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom  his next words were  half hour into the flight  i need to suggest that don and mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad   the words after  should  were bleeped out by a msnbc exec  which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about savage s sexual orientation  savage asked if he was a  sodomite   to which the caller answered  yes   savage then said to the caller   oh  so you re one of those sodomites  you should only get aids and die  you pig  how s that  why do nt you see if you can sue me  you pig  you got nothing better to do than to put me down  you piece of garbage  you got nothing better to do today  go eat a sausage and choke on it  get trichinosis  now do we have another nice caller here who s busy because he did nt have a nice night in the bathhouse who s angry at me today  put another  put another sodomite onno more calls  i do nt care about these bums  they mean nothing to me  they re all sausages    before the show was canceled  msnbc was replaying his show during primetime hours saturday night  many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments  and that msnbc was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups  others point out that msnbc has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network

__label__0 cursed  is the most pathetic werewolf movie i ve seen since  an american werewolf in paris   the acting is terrible  directing is poor  shame on you mr craven  and the storyline is largely uncompelling  the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience  this movie seems to cater to the teens and early s people who might think something like this is  cool   but if you re looking for a scary movie  do nt look for  cursed   well  at least it s not as bad as  an american werewolf in paris   but that sure as hell is nt saying much
__label__0 do not buy this iron  it s fabulous while it works  for which it does merit the one star  but it broke in less than a week  it overheated  or something  and then would nt turn on again  but here s the kicker  if you buy it from amazon  the company wo nt honor the warranty  i do nt have particularly heavyduty hair  this is just totally unacceptable
__label__0 i have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide  but  it is good for recharging my batteries when i have to write a review and feel uninspired  after reading through some ideas in this guide  i usually find i can then find my own words to say what i need to convey  the fact that all the phrases are positive  i see as a good thing because i feel it s important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you re reviewing  if there are challenges in the persons performance  the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period  i would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing  rather than use the phrases in the book  the people we manage deserve more than  copy  paste  reviews
__label__0 i am not at all happy with this product  the instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive  it was a total waste of my money and time
__label__0 shannon lawson is capable of a much better album  i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots  and it was amazing  if they were to put out a cd i m sure it would be one of my favorites  shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that s what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd  instead they gave it this generic  overproduced sound  leaving shannon sound like everyone else  with the way bluegrass is selling these days  it s a shame that shannon could nt showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena
__label__1 with his snarling  gritty guitar tones  swampy grooves  and scratchy vocals  cc adcock makes buttshakin  music that blends rockabilly  oldschool memphis rb  new orleans funk  cajun dancehall tunes  and jukejoint blues  he s young  but no poseur  having paid dues with bo diddley and buckwheat zydeco  adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand  but despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass  this is nt a retrosounding record  adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous  doyle bramhall joins adcock on two songs  and together they raise string hell  boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude  adcock s music is soulful  somewhat twisted  and deeply satisfying
__label__1 shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book  the story is incredibly engrossing  the atmosphere set for each scene is really topnotch  and the journey paul takes his character s through is really incredible  we see personal demons and struggles of the heroes  struggles with faith  the journey of an antihero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey  the villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human  if you are a fan of fantasy literature  definitely pick this one up  you wo nt regret it  as a side note  you might want to pick up the previous books by paul featuring erevis cale as well

__label__1 i have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software  i appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro  con examples given  since i am not a lawyer  i am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure i made the correct choices  i did complete the healthcare directive and it compares well with others i ve seen used in my state  i need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask  my only complaint is that i declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so i would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney  it did not arrive in a timely manner and i was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms i wanted the attorney to look at  it is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging  for a basic package  i decided to keep the cd anyway  when it finally arrived  just in case i have a hard drive failure
__label__0 i bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what i got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out  the guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron  it s better than an mfsl disc because the artist approved it  yeah right  get real  i might need a new hifi if i do nt like the sound  please  you idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does peter mew or rob caiger  thanks for nothing  sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practicessaying that the fulllength version of  roll over beethoven  was used  what a crock  and so what if they used the original master tapes  using a master tape does nt mean anything if you re going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly  do nt buy this disc  hang onto the old us versions  or even better  the japanese issue  do nt give sony your money for this shambles of a product
__label__0 after  days of minimal use  this pad stopped working  kaz replaced it  after  days of use  the pad stopped working again  kaz replaced it again  after  days of use  the pad stopped working a third time  but this time kaz voided the warranty  then  they said i should get an electric blanket if i wanted to keep warm  i wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache
__label__1 this simple scale is light  easy to carry and store  i tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale  it read the same weight  but actually with less flucuation when i shifted on it  i was careful to keep it on a flat surface  i had good luck on old hardwood floors  less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom  it was very consistent on a level surface  i tested it several times in a row with the same reading  and various times throughout the day  nothing read unusually  i really like the form factor of this scale  it s so small  not small spacewise  but just thin  light  with a nice solid place to plant your feet

__label__1 i so love the size and shape of this camera  this one takes some good pictures  and appear to be quite clear  it s better than the integrated camera on my cell phone  this camera may seem like it s taken a poor quality image  but when you transfer them onto a pc  they seem so clear  however it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has mb of internal memory  as this camera was a gift to me  i d have to say it was the best birthday present i have received
__label__0 chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist  and it pains me to give this book such a low mark  it s hard to say much without giving away the plot  but i found the plot contrived and manipulative   too clever for its own good  the book started strong  but as the main character became more disassociated with reality  i became more disassociated with the book  i finished it  but it was a struggle
__label__0 i ve had this camera just over a year  figures  and it has gone completely bonkers on me  sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless  you never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not   making it completely unreliable  keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business  so it was nt abused  dropped  thrown in the bottom of a purse  etc it was treated very carefully and probably only shot about    pictures total  frankly  i m kind of glad it broke so that i have an excuse to replace it  here s why   takes beautiful still shots  but forget about any kind of action  it takes too long between shots to get good action  it also blurs nearly all the action shots i ve ever taken  regardless of what mode it s in   the redeye is aweful  it should do better  i doubt that i ll ever buy another canon

__label__0 reviewgium  volume i  issue xvii over sixty and still going strong  neil young has released a new album  largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on us president george w  bush  as opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet  countrytinged effort  living with war is a pretty much straightforward rock album  mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks  as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks  musically  it s nothing spectacular  in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula  and there are really no diversions from the grungelike rhythm guitar chords  but the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics  of course  many people do not like neil young s vocals  but there are many welldeveloped choral passages throughout the album  including a soulful  a capella arrangement of  america the beautiful   which closes the album  so basically  i feel the vocal performances compensate though not totally for the lack of musical diversity  lyrically  the album is pretty blatant  it could almost be a  s protest album  but underlying that  is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better  there are a few decent tracks on the album  even if they are not exactly mindblowing  not that neil young was ever a showboater    after the garden  is actually quite a good song as is  shock and awe    flags of freedom  is a bit of an upper  so i can probably call that the album highlight  though i m sure the more politicallyminded citizen will enjoy  let s impeach the president   an almost humorous overview of bush s faltering standpoints  the final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest  and offer feelings of hope and introspection  if you are not a fan of neil young  you ll find nothing here that will convert you  so you may just want to leave this on the shelf  if you are  antibush  you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect  but that s probably the only thrill you will get  i tend to avoid anything political  so music aside  this album s message does not really appeal to me  it s like  yeah  people hate the president  blah blah blah  we knowgive it a rest  for fans of neil  i would nt exactly say  you re not missing anything  by avoiding this album  there is some good stuff on there  but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the  used  bin at your local cd shop  and for those interested  this is not a crazy horse album
__label__1 over the years at various jobs  i have seen this flashlight several times  it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse  it may end up looking beat up and yucky  but they always work  no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it  if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox  work truck  pickup glove compartment  etc  this is the only one you need  if you need a good flashlight at home  and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store  this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy  i finally bought one just for my home  and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago  i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox  i refuse to replace it   i like this version because it has a strong magnet  and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck  i also like that it has switch guards  so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath  of stuff in your toolbox  one nitpicky complaint  it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector  however  it comes empty and you have to supply your own  so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight

__label__0 midway  was the decisive naval engagement of the second world war   decided by a handful of bombs hitting the japanese carriers over a period of a few minutes  it is a riveting story that has been well told in several movies and innumerable books  not here  relying upon outtakes from  tora tora tora   and the wonderful japanese cast of that film  what we have here is a pedestrian outing that should be avoided at all costs  quite honestly  the best version of the battle of midway was steven spielberg s original  star wars   before it had roman numberals

__label__1 worked like a charm in my panasonic agdv video camera  having  hours of battery life really helps when you re on vacation and do nt want to mess with charging batteries or being  selective  in your shooting  this gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later  worth the money and a good deal here
__label__1 i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas  and he is absolutely in love with them  the distance it can handle is slightly above average  but the clarity is really where this thing shines  its very easy to use  and has held up reasonably well  i would recomend it to the casual user
__label__1 i ca nt believe this application  i bought it last year and i have  pages completed  i can truthfully say that i will never scrapbook the traditional way from this moment on  so fast and easy  i will be all up to date with my scrap booking for xmas   i am overjoyed  i do nt believe i know anyone who scrapbooks traditionally anymore  thanks for simplifying my life
__label__1 this software is wonderful  i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years  i ve tried broderbund  sp   whose interface was too clumsy  nova which was rather difficult at times  many things you ca nt do  and now this  when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very  very few backgrounds  templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this  i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them  but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages  i did nt get halfway through the video  i had figured out how to do it  i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i ve ever made  within hours i had a beautiful collage  letter to send with my holiday cards  my husband s first impression was a heartfelt  it s lovely   what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background  i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want  i ve been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it  png format   i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now  i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator  but then it probably is nt as complicated to use  from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve   you can also use the eyedropper tool to  pick up  any color from any picture  background  or element  read  anything   in the program  i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched  i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches  you can also remove backgrounds from photos  it takes a bit of time to do  but the area around the image will be transparent  this functionality has many uses  you can also save your files in many different formats including jpg for file sharing  etc there are so many more features i could nt possibly list them here  nor would you want me too  too much time   if you only use premade templates and do nt feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software  you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe   which i liked  and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program  you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities  the great thing about this program is that it is nt just for scrapbooking  you can do all your photo manipulation in it  i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have nt been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version   but i kept using that version  i m so glad i got version  as it is very user friendly too  but please know that version   which comes with this package  is not the most recent version  version  is out now  if you do nt want  need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes png files  portable network graphics format  or make your own  i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having  i highly recommend the training videos on the cd  they really help
__label__1 i have another camera w  x optical  tons of features but i wanted something compact  ready to take quick snaps  this fits the bill  on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots  the xlarge screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera  canon a  either that or my hand is steadier  last but not least  the battery life was impeccable  i took a nearly  photos  plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge  the battery is a  custom  one which concerned me but the charger is very compact and travels well  it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use  no cables
__label__0 bought two of these  one as a gift and one for myself  luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away  this thing just vibrates  no massage at all   after  seconds you get nauseaits not worth its a piece of junk  trust me you are not getting a bargain  i guess you pay for what you get  but in this case i ca nt even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub
__label__1 av materials for catalan are very difficult to find  but catalan is certainly worth investigating  and this makes for a highly pleasant intro  now if only eurotalk would come up with a second cd
__label__0 i saw this movie years ago  but did nt remember much about it  except some of the songs  and the basic story  i also saw  nights of cabiria   from which the story was taken  i love musicals  and i think shirley maclaine is very talented  she is very sweet as charity hope valentine  and one ca nt help wanting a happy ending for her  so why did i think this movie was awful  first of all  some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating  how many times can you listen to charity say  fickle finger of fate  over and over without wanting to hit the mute button  also  some of the scenes went on and on and on  especially the elevator scene  and  the intermission was totally unnecessary  but the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers  i did nt like any of them   they were so far over the top as to be silly  bob fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could   instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers  he had so much busyness in all of them  too many people  costumes that did nt fit the story  silly moves  and they all went past the point of enjoyment  i fast forwarded thru a couple of them just to get them over with  i have never done that before with any movie  this could have been so much better  the story was good  the charactors were good  but the whole thing should have been toned down  the movie could have been  minutes shorter if there had been some trimming  it was entirely too long  also   all that stop action  what was that all about  i know  i know  it was to show the progress of the story  but it was a distraction  i did nt like the movie and was glad when it was over
__label__0 i like the idea  but the slippers just are nt comfortable to stand on  it s great while you are sitting  though
__label__0 i ve had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer s assessment that the battery does not hold much power  i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory  but this delkin model s life span was noticeably short  now i am going to buy a new charger  battery altogether because i do nt want to buy another delkin battery
__label__0 i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years  this new model erk is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement  it s nice and quiet  and i m sure the vacuum works great  but i would nt know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim  we re talking about hairs easily     in length  a trimmer should be able to shave those down  do nt you think  if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors  do nt bother even trying this product  it s a waste of money
__label__0 i ve been a loyal norton antivirus  utilities software customer since the stone age  but like several other reviewers  i m deeply disappointed that norton internet security  is incompatible with zonealarm pro  sunbelt counterspy  and microsoft antispyware  and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out  once upon a time  norton was the epitome of welldesigned  thoughtful  customercentric software  but they ve degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a wellestablished name  i ll be returning symantec s software if i can  and buying zonealarm s a  v package instead

__label__0 the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence  this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good  it is mainly a mellowdrama surrounding the lives of the characters  some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor  but there s no mystery

__label__0 children of the corn ii terence knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage  the special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like  years later which in itself makes it even worst  the acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production  the gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to holly upstairs acting school to write such junk  and to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me
__label__0 i have to say i am disappointed  having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number   which i felt gave me a good trim  i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon  the one i received was much cheaper in quality  the plastic guide is cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually  which it did within  weeks from being dropped  the guide shattered  there is no replacement for the position guide for the  i can find  now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom  or finding a razor that can survive real world use  on the plus side  the battery life on this razor is incredible

__label__0 i watched this with some trepidation  and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be  it was better because it remained fairly true to the original  in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending  it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original  and i found stone s lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting  a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd  one was the london setting  which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns  the other was sharon stone s rather plucky performance  and the presence of charlotte rampling  who has aged into a different kind of beauty  morrisey does nt even come close to filling michael douglas s shoes  and it s hard to feel sorry for him at the end  as with the first movie  you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made  the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one  however  both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex  there s nothing wrong with either of these things  but here they just get in the way
__label__1 as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts  crafts style  i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture s history and design evolution  with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text  this book illustrates the origins of arts  crafts furniture in england and its progression  first to our east coast  and eventually westward across america  in fact  my only  complaint  about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more  because of the depth of information presented here  i would not say that this is a general interest read  rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts  crafts movement and its recent revival
__label__0 i am a fan of historical fiction  and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen  what bothers me the most is that the general public  who has nt read the tudor biographies like some of us have  will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject  i wo nt go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them  why tamper with history  when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
__label__1 this dvd of the wiggles is my    year old grandsons favorite  he watches it every day and never tires of it  i enjoy watching it with him  the wiggles are great entertainment for people of all ages  i do nt think you can go wrong with the wiggles
__label__0 this is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you ve probably never heard of  if you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you
__label__1 the best book on the history of world war ii that i ve read in a long time  the title has three meanings   it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber  the brits called these people  rear gunners   the yanks used the term  tail gunner   it s the most dangerous position in the plane   the last plane in the formation  this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage  this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation  it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there are nt so many guns pointing that direction   it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war  this splendid book covers all three of these meanings  in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany
__label__0 do not buy this camera  i repeat do not buy this camera  just read the reviews and you ll know exactly what i mean  lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas  so i did nt spend a dime on it  i opened the package before reading any reviews  now i wish i ve read the reviews before opening the box  i do nt care what setting you use  i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera  the lighting sucks  you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones  i really wanted this camera to work  it looks sweet but sadly it ca nt take pictures
__label__1 a great ending to a great series  it left me craving more  not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful  plus mugen and jin s final  for the time being  battle was great  leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle  it was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie
__label__1 based on the bestselling novels by michael and jeff shaara   gods and generals  and  gettysburg   based on the elder shaara s  the killer angels   are the most excting and emotional civil war epics ever filmed  the battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic civil war battle sequences ever put on screen  the acting is phenomenal  with the likes of jeff daniels  stephen lang  tom berenger  robert duvall  bruce boxleitner  martin sheen  richard jordan  sam elliott and mira sorvino  but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies  director ronald f  maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films  giving rise to the hope that the last film   the last full measure   will complete what will hopefully be the best civil war trilogy ever made   gods and generals  movie  dvd grade  a  gettysburg  movie  dvd grade  a overall grade  a
__label__1 i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try  i am happy with all of the tracks  some tracks remind me of beatles a little  but not all  so the band does have a unique sound  even though from the s  the sound is like many bands making it today  i like it

__label__0 i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera  i only have  lenses  but the bag is capable of holding the camera and  lenses as well as pockets for cables  batteries  etc i think this is a great unit  for the beginner  like me  or the pro
__label__1 the great locomotive chase  is the stuff of legend  this somewhat obscure event  which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter  could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark  a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days  to second manassas  to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union  but firsttime author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms  telling it well  and placing it in its proper context  the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue  espionage  and derringdo  and if mr bonds had only told the tale itself  this book would be well worth the read  but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr bonds s ability to tell this gripping tale objectively  while putting it in its proper context  the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas  and by doing so  and by explaining why the raid  coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama  offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war  mr bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï½lan of the raiders its proper place  andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark  even though students of the era will have the natural reaction   what were they thinking   mr bonds answers that question  and the answer  as incongruous as it may seem  reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia  if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid  reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished  this would be a wonderful adventure story  in the great tradition of shelby foote s narrative history of the war  but this book does so much more  it puts the raid in its proper strategic context  and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed  this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale welltold
__label__0 about half the songs are great old songs i m familiar with  the other half are songs made famous by other artists and most are clangers for elvis that are painful to listen to
__label__0 the best thing about this book is its table of contents  in second place is the preface  and then it s all downhill  if you want to buy a list of topics in electronic communications  with brief summaries that explain absolutely nothing whatsover in any great  or even little  detail  and you really have no other use for your hard earned  dollars  then please go ahead and buy this book  if however  you value your cash  and would rather buy a book that rather than insulting your intelligence  at least attempts in good faith to teach you something  then please  do nt fall for the marketing ploy of the title  rf microelectronics   because there s very little  rf  and even less  microelctronics  in this text  here s a taste of the marketing ploy from the very first line of the preface   the annual worldwide sales of cellular phones has exceeded b   do i see dollar signs in your eyes  i thought so  do nt fall for the trap  if you want to learn a thing or two about rf electronics theory as well as detailed explanations of what the job of each individual component  like a capacitor here or a resistor there  in a communication circuit is  then buy  modern electronic communication  th edition  by gary m miller  the miller book s th edition is coming out soon  even with  pages of text  it costs only  i believe razavi s book should never have been published because frankly  it s not a book at all  why it s still in print  though stuck at first edition for nearly  years   is completely beyond any sane person s comprehension
__label__1 this book is truly lovely about finding friendship in the most unexpected of places  i cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it immensely  and you wo nt get tired of reading it to your kids either
__label__0 horrible book  the racist continues his trend of substandard writing
__label__0 good  but it simply was nt actionous enough  i do nt mind having no action in a book  otherwise how else could i love foundation so much    but children was a book that needed to have action in it  unfortunately it did nt really  too much philosophical babble that i had to reread to get it  slightly reminiscent of card s later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue  too much about jane  not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender  which annoyed me  to my shock ender s death did not really impact me in any way  beyond   huh  waitender is dead    so little was his role in the book  he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether  edit  from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time  i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars  just keep in mind that while it says two  it means three
__label__0 all of us have a dark side  unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane s life and expands it out of proportion  in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane s life and career as window dressing  even the screenplay is  at best  an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h  carpernter   since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twiceaccused murder suspect  in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane s extracurricular activities  my interest in the film was as a hogan s heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful sixyear series  bob crane s professional credits alone would make for a good film  auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane s socalled  secret life  and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd  facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane s private life  auto focus  however  should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine  you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan s heroes television series
__label__0 the power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself  you would nt get that from the picture  too bad  other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger
__label__0 ok  i ve listened to fat boy slim  that guy s stuff is nt bad  by no means main stream  but worth while  but  this norman cook  he s horrible  it s no wonder cook developed an alter ego  with the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes  i could nt believe this  quot  stuffquot  had come from the same artist that produced praise you  renegade master is the type of track i ve come to know and respect  that one is a keeper   and i have to give props for i left my wallet in el segundo  other than that  this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market  if this is the sound you re looking for  save a few bucks  check out your local yard sales  so as not to be too negative  i ll say this  the printing job on the cd itself is charming  the notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired

__label__1 this was one of the first lenses that i purchased with my rebel xt  now after taking several thousand pictures with it i can honestly say it was well worth the cost  i very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod  i also have the mm f  l macro lens  which costs about  times more than this lens  and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the x and x tc s  it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod  the mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so  i have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results  allinall  given it s small size and light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot
__label__0 do nt be fooled by the enticing  megpixels that this camera offers  i d been waiting along time to upgrade from my  mp nikon coolpix sq as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop  what ve i ve discovered  however  is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution  mp images from this hp camera that the additional resolution is worthless  the images look absolutely horrible  my little nikon sq with it s lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size  do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you re buying is a good one

__label__1 i actually enjoy it more than the matrix  check it out  i liked it  so will you
__label__0 this album was released in  and now  seven years later  this album does not even matter  britney spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child  great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity  innovation  creativity  and ability to transcend cultures and generations  great music stirs something inside the listener  and matters to the person who created it  britney spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things  it saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally  and yet  the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years  decades  even  after their release  music like this  britney spears and her peers  disappears into the folds of time  it does not matter
__label__1 there are many gorgeous photos of both the insides and outsides of public and personal spaces  i was actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into  if you enjoy interior design  of just about any style  you will find it here  i love all the personal libraries shown  crammed with books and interesting objects  loved the mannequins  esp the lifesized guy sitting on the couch  i am a fan of exotic  eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with the book
__label__1 this album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings  sheryl crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history  sheryl shines on her own  singing some of her great hits  but it s the duets that really make the album  my least favorite has to be the dixie chicks just because i ca nt appreciate the country flare they bring to  strong enough  but it s still a great version  chrissie hynde  one of the album s highlights  brings intense attitude to  if it makes you happy   still one of my favorite sheryl songs  stevie nicks remains stevie nicks  giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own  gold dust woman   sarah mclachlan s usually soft voice comes out strong on  the difficult kind  and compliments sheryl s quite nicely  my favorite rendition has to be eric clapton and sheryl together on cream s  white room   the rockout moment on the album  the show is complete when all the guests return to belt out bob dylan s  tombstone blues  and close the show with a definite bang
__label__1 i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product  i have created numerous videos of my children s escapades and sporting events  i do have one warning however  provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen  the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use  my wildest expectations were exceeded
__label__0 i m not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation  backpacking pictures  the p was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned  one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it  on the p the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on  i accidently dropped it from about   off the ground when it was only a few days old  it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens  the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus  i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty  they charged  to fix it  mastercard has a program called  purchase assurance  that will hopefully cover the repair cost  the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from  feet  get wet  or even frozen down to  degrees f and still take pictures  i wish i had seen that ad first  the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera  not buying nikon anymore
__label__0 i installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors i was getting  i have windows xp   well   weeks and  it s what it took for me to have my computer repaired  it would not let me log on to windows  i got errors i ve never seen and it completely messed all my files  big waste of money  i had to reformat my hard drive and my computer is only  month old

__label__0 it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment  considering the makeup of the cast  nicolas cage  bridget fonda  and rosie perez among others  the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning  million dollars on the ny state lotto  decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day  the acting is surprisingly    below average  the dialogues are way below average  while the plot is not bad at all  nicolas cage s character is too naive and too slow  and that was just sad  pitiful  bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland  rosie perez s character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on  as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing  they do nt seem to belong  subsequently  they are not convincing in their roles at all  finally  somebody shoot the  narrator   please  though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off  a shame really  no masterpiece here  if nicolas cage is what you had in mind  check out the amazing movies city of angels and  or the family man
__label__0 book contains many useful lists  charts  comparisons to define giftedness  many helpful hints about raising a gifted child  main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general   and may push those with  quot  normalquot  kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track   when they should not  gifted kids are the exception  not the norm as this book makes it seem
__label__1 wow  i love this spykids movie way better than the first one  i think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the cortezes and even more characters  like the giggleses  we met donnagon in the first movie  and he was the reason for the cortez parents to go on the mission  now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the oss  and what about alexandra  the preisidants daughter  she is the main reason we know about the transmooker device  right  also grandma and grandpa cortez are joining us in this movie  i think robert rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel  spy kids   the island of lost dreams   the sequel is awesome
__label__0 just like in my other review i ca nt figure out the madness over these guys  i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way  honestly people you ca nt call these guys artists  an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together  it s as simple as that  and to top it of they do nt have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either  a comment like  they rock  or  the lead singer is soooo hot  are nt examples of a great artist or band  from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain  kind of like the validity of this record  because there has nt been a post on here for two years  if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews  and checkout some relevant and great music
__label__1 we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program  university of los andes  colombia   there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one  eg  people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs   however  to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded  when other reviewers give  star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur  this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis  in chapter  you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic  sums and logical quantifications are  for example  treated in an uniform way  maybe the type concept is not so fine explained  but one has to remember that this is an introductory book   stars  of course
__label__1 this product does wonders  it helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week  like another customer  i have sensitive skin  i did nt feel this dried my skin out at all  but a word to the wise  make sure to read the directions carefully  this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints  if used properly  its fantastic
__label__0 this software is useless  it is a slow and a system resource hog  you can download dozens of free apps that do a better job than this for free
__label__0 i dont take neither stance on religion nor science with these comments  i have read the book and i have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly  it has one goal  sell  sell  sell  if you are after useful  quality  informative  knowledge to gain  well you wont find it here  im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says  nonfiction   the author is a talented story teller  add a few statistics here and there  a dash of scientific key figures  mix it with life s controversial unsolved mysteries  a few more dash of historic events and famous people  add and link a few references here and there  and wala     you have a best seller  isnt that ironic  it is a  new york times number  best seller  it was an interesting read though
__label__1 i needed a tele lens to complement my d purchase  a did nt want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz in sharpness  this certainly did and the vr really works  i am able to take sharp pictures up to    my d flies on it
__label__0 it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it s loyal clientele  the fusion is a classic example  from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel  do nt buy into the hype  the fusion is an expensive joke of a product

__label__1 this has to be the best of the alien films  this film  although not as scary as the original  i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien   it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first  also  this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series  go on  buy the collector s edition of the first and this and enjoy
__label__0 if you re looking to capture  the decisive moment  with the nikon coolpix   stop do not buy this camera    for that matter  carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture  action   because what you think you see  may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image  let me briefly explain where i m coming from  i made my living as a field photojournalist for  years  by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and bw film images  i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years  although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses   starting with the original nikon f slr  which i still have  and finishing up with the ns and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths  i like nikon equipment a lot  i decided to begin working with digital images last year  i was attracted to the coolpix  because the  spread  on the zoom lens was the mm camera equivalent of mm mm  when i worked with film i probably used my mm and mm nikkors more than any others in my bag  so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package  let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism  it is  nevertheless  a marvel of human ingenuity  for many other uses such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture  put another way  things that do nt move   it works wonderfully well  seriously  i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature  the images can only be described as superb  if i do say so myself   i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot  working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the   which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days   did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter  etc point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment  even then  i d sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table  of course with digital  i  you  do nt have to worry about any of that stuff  one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you re good to go  alas  the shutter lag on this  and many other digital cameras made these days  is the  downcheck  which makes me unable to recommend the  there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with  the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image  the precise composition of which lasts only a splitsecond  i have taken many good pictures of people working   action  shots and the like  but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose  essentially  my shooting eye  which is pretty damned good  had nothing to with it  it s like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machinegun if he fires enough rounds  one of them is going to hit the other guy  marksmanship has nothing to do with it  samesame shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag  if you shoot enough images  statistically you re probably going to get a good one  but it s not a very good way to do things  so if you re looking to capture what henri cartierbresson  i m not sure i ve spelled his name correctly  so artfully described as  the decisive moment   look at a digital singlelens reflexes  or wait for improvements in digicams
__label__0 i received this tweezer for christmas  so i m glad i did nt spend anything for it because it s not even worth  cents  the tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs  it s a piece of crap as far as i m concerned  do not bother purchasing this product  if you do  you ll regret it

__label__1 the dreaming was one of those albums that i found in my parents cd collection when i was young and i have nt outgrown it yet  my parents seemed to hate it and never bought a kate bush cd after it  though i recently bought her whole collection except  the whole story  as it s just a greatest hits    this album took me a very long time to get into however  i listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because i thought it was too strange  i took it out then several years later and loved it  i would now say it could be my all time favourite cd and is better than  hounds of love  as i see it  the songs all stand on their own and bush s voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through  this is the only album that i will never skip a track because i m always in the mood for them all    sat in your lap   a great opening track  bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not  the instruments are great as always    there goes a tenner   a notable song for the quirky british accent bush puts on  the instruments are very good and remind me of the   s  as it was made then    that was a good decade for music    pull out the pin   the piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good  the lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade  the song was inspired by a documentary    suspended in gaffa   i do nt actually know what gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy  the lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent    leave it open   an excellent song that reminds me more of  hounds of love   the instrumentation is excellent as always    the dreaming   another brilliant song which is so funny because of bush s australian accent  the production is good and so is the songwriting    night of the swallow   the use of irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song  the singing by bush is superb and the song is flawless    all the love   the song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent  the lyrics are unusual and very well done  the instruments complement bush s superb voice and never overtake    houdini   the album cover is to do with this song  the song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation    get out of my house   a perfect way to end an amazing album  the lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule  within the song obviously   it is something only kate bush could have written  overall i think it is an amazing album though i can see why people do nt like it  it could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect  kate bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best  yes  she s better than tori amos   she is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist  reccomended to everyone into alternative  especially tori amos fans  mark
__label__0 i guess i really should nt complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally  but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizablywhere you ca nt even tell what you have taken  if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars  even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did  on this useless piece of crap
__label__1 i loved this book  it talked about every facet of the stock market  but did nt go overboard with jargon  i knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book i am ready to learn more  it was well written  interesting  and  unlike some investing books  the author was not trying to sell anything  this is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest but has no knowledge of the subject  i really enjoyed this book
__label__1 this book   the relatives came  by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell  was a delight to read  i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive  likewise  i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit  and  i felt as if i  too  were a part of this book  having experienced growing up in a small town where you don  t see that many people  i believe that when relatives come to visit  it almost seems like christmas  as a result  when the book expressed the joy  laughter  and celebration of family  it stirred up these memories of the past  unquestionably  almost anyone  from children to adults  could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit
__label__0 the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over  i brought them home and there is fog inside  also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get toand it is on the lens  i called bushnell s help line and they told me   well  it is nt internally fog proof  just externally  when asked about the stuff on the inside   that is probably fungus  that sometimes happens  i just bought the binoculars    he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out  avoid these at all costs    they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
__label__0 before you donate your hardearned money yet again to bill gates   feed the multibillionaire fund   do yourself and the world a favor and search for  star office   on amazon and read the reviews there  i use ms office professional  in the office  and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by microsoft for this bloatware  star office  is under  from amazon and is fully compatible with microsoft office  and includes full functionalities of ms word  excel  powerpoint  visio  and access  let me know what ms software i can buy under   let alone  hopefully  this is the beginning of the end of the microsoft monopoly  and the dawning of the era of sanity in computer software
__label__0 while i absolutely love the show on pbs  this season was mispackaged  the box and dvd were both labeled series   but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series    unfortunately  i did nt try watching this disc until several months after i bought it  if you buy this  be sure you view it promptly to be certain it s the correct series
__label__0 one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm  no way   those two books were edgeofyourseat reading experiences  this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring  the action does nt start until about halfway or more into the book and even then  the cliched writing and deification of balf s subjects make this book very hard to get through  unless you are a serious kayaking fan  i would not recommend this book
__label__0 if i m not mistaken  the only difference between the standard th anniversary edition and the  ultimate collector s edition  is   collectible robby the robot replica   forbidden planet and the invisible boy reproduction lobby cards portfolio   forbidden planet original theatrical poster mailin offer   metal alloy collector s case in that case  the  ultimate collector s edition   at more than twice the price of the standard edition  is a ripoff  the  robby the robot replica  is much smaller and much less detailed than the one depicted in the ad the mail in offer for the  free  poster requires a  shipping and handling fee  the  metal alloy collectors case  is made of very thin metal and arrived dented  not that it would take much to dent it  save  and buy the standard version
__label__1 my last braun razor was model   which i purchased  years ago  the braun  is a pleasure using  quick and close shave  the technology has come a long way  i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet
__label__1 this camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording  since it is an upper end product  it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features  there are  however  a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment  the provided microphone jack is an     stereo  in my camera  at least  it is not mounted very securely  when i have an external mike connected  i had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it  otherwise  the sound would drop off  a friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened  the master switch moves from off to vcr mode  up one   record to tape mode  down one  or record to stick mode  down two   it is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark  this can be frustrating and i cannot help but believe there is a better design that could be used  the  vcr  controls are located on the top surface of the camera  they are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols  they are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine  you can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which  if any  of the functions are selected  it is still usable but it is a pain in the backside  there are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now
__label__0 just repeat the following several times    draggy plot   uninspired acting  especially allen  who almost sinks it   unimaginative  story  direction  etc  then get a hitchcock film
__label__1 if you like math  i guarantee you ll like this book  the author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from th and th century mathematics  newton  leibniz  the bernoullis  and euler s gamma function   he continues into the th century with riemann and lebesque integrals  weierstrass  pathological functions  cantor s set theory  and winds up with baire s category theorem  reading this book is like taking a guided tour through real analysis   calculus of one real variable  with the math prof you always wished you had  its only prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus  the main points are explained very clearly  so the reader can skip through the book or fill in the details  and will learn a lot  either way  the book is very well written  and a great pleasure to read  i highly recommend it  for students  fans  and teachers
__label__1 if you like the beach boys and appreciate the technical quality behind telarc recordings  then this disc is a must have in your collection  first  papa doo run run does an excellent job covering beach boys tunes to the point where some people ca nt tell the difference  but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it  second  you ll feel like your hearing parts of the music you ve never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording  you can hear each instrument clearly  the beginning of  quot  i get aroundquot  is almost explosive  they way the original recording should have been  telarc and papa doo run run have made a special album here  when i feel like listening to the beach boys  i usually grab this cd first
__label__0 wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself  wo nt enjoy  two womanizers fall in love  one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin  like first off  what does virginity have to do with love   second  who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin   then owen wilson s character fall in love with rachel s mcadams character and well  that s the usual predictable romance plot  the problem with this film is it s not that funny  it seems to think it s better then it is  i do nt think i hardly laughed during this film  the part about the  supposive  gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course  because it s this kind of film  he ends up being gay and of course  he tries to hit on vince vaughn s character in a scene that is beyond creepy  lets just say that  gay  guy is prob one of the worst actors i ve seen   then we get a cameo from will ferrell  alot of people i know find this guy  so  funny  but i do nt get it  it just was nt funny to me  u know  i loved the classic   american pie  that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy  this film was nt so much funny as stupid   for the most part  i m not going to remember this film in  years from now because it s just an average film
__label__1 tastes better than most candy bars and has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients

__label__1 this is a great book i love it and its very interesting  great information and pricing
__label__1 i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress  it was pretty pungent  but it felt so good the first time i layed in it  after a couple days it appeared to lose it s memory and start to dent and crease  but eventually it got back to full expansion  the customer service with this item was fantastic  we ll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
__label__1 we love underdogs  here is a plain girl who finds happiness  there is alot more to this character than she is given credit for  we ve watched it about  times in the past  yrs  if you like  ugly betty  or any sort of cinderella type stories  this one is for you  it is an australian movie
__label__1 no doubt about it  from start to finish  this is a classic for anybody s collection  i can remember back in the spring of   when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today  this was rap music at it s best from spice  to dj quik  there will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods  so add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap  west coast fan  like myself   or just want to hear a great soundtrack
__label__0 i ve had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned  i have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week  the length adjuster on the side of the clippers does nt hold  if the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down  tightening the screw did nt help either  the attachments do nt fit right  especially the blend attachment  this attachment can only be used if you do nt mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull  the only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck
__label__1 having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks  any help will be appreciated  kroh
__label__1 i did nt think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release  but they have  while  faded seaside glamour  is more immediately catchy and refined   you see colours  comes at you in a much more intense manner  the songs are more mature  the musicianship is topnotch and the recording sparkles with fat bottomend and soaring harmonies  the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer  but there s honestly not a bad track on this release  the delays put it all together  great songwriting  strong musicianship and excellent production in a genrebending mix that has something for everybody  it s a shame these guys do nt get more recognition here in the states  buy it
__label__1 i got this camera about  years ago because my sd  broke  it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures  its also very sleek and small
__label__1 also bought as a gift but i tried it  very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in the mall
__label__1 this  debut album from this texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from jason mcmaster  catchy guitar riffs  and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good timeit fits quite nicely in my cd collection in the  d  column next to the dirty looks cdi thought  scared  was the best song on here along with the opener   teasin pleasin  and  queen of the nile  but i liked all of themthe best way to describe dangerous toys is that it has a heavy guns n roses sound with a poppier edge to itit s too bad they never made a good album after this one and dangerous toys would never get to this level againif you want late  s hard rock  metal without the spandex and the makeup  this debut album is highly recommendednothing fancy  just good old fashioned rock and roll
__label__1 their th album as a complete group  not counting the few album havoc  prodeje put out  is my least favorite of the  scc albums i have  i do nt have the one from  or    but it still gets itself a  star rating  out of the  songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping   are ok and the other  are good  like all their albums  guests are minimal and are on are on  of the  songs  production is mostly handled by prodeje  as with all their albums  he does get a little help from robert  fonksta  bacon  tomie mundie  a good album to have for scc fans but not their best work                        f  cbo  spice   prophet    also on their  gangsta conversation  album      f  daz dillinger    good beat         good beat  deeper song   my favorite on here         another deeper song     scc is    havikk  prodeje  havoc  lv  dj gripp  dj kaos check all my review
__label__1 after just  weeks of using this product my fasting blood sugar has dropped to  thats over  points     pretty impressive  my dr started me on metformin but it made me very sick  this stuff works much better wiht no side effects  i wish i had known about this years ago as i have been fighting with high fasting sugars for years  this product is a god send
__label__0 i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it  the quality of the pictures is very poor  showing large grain  even at shq and low iso settings  no combination of settings seems to improve quality
__label__0 this shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower  but that s about it  the shave is nt very close  and it takes a long time to shave  to do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor
__label__0 what s up   the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune  which  i always thought  would have been the perfect song for heart   is the only thing good here  the rest of this album is a mess  linda perry has  of course  gone on to better things
__label__0 i purchased this camera from amazon recently  the first time around  the camera tape door would nt shut the very first time i opened it  i returned the camera and amazon was great about replcing it promptly  the second time around  the dv port worked once  and only once  there s a short in it  there is a reason this camera is so cheap  it s j u n k   i will add that a friend of mine is on her second jvc as well  a fact i did not know until all of this came about  for two stars  i ll say the video quality is good  the camera battery does hold a full  min  charge  i had no sound issues what so ever  background noise   none here  as for still pictures  if you do nt know what you re doing as far as shutter speeds  back light  etc forget it  the still pictures are very grainy  if you want professional looking stills  do not buy a camcorder for this purpose  jvc tech support is useless  camcorder comes with a usb wire to upload still only  as on any digital camcorders  you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port  you need a firewire  this does not come with one  also  you need to check if you have a firewire port on your computer  i paid app   dollars here on amazon including shipping  for a port and firewire  it took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower  it s no big deal  amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time  only refund my money  this camera is now listed as  cheaper than when i bought it last month  overall  amazon was great about service and return  however  this particular jvc item is junk
__label__0 gosh  i would really like to review this adapter  but   amazon has put my order on indefinate hold  as thier supplier is unable to get any more  but wait  what s that blurb on the product page   availability  ususally ships within  hours  and  want it delivered tomorrow  order it in the next  hours and  minutes  and choose oneday shipping at checkout  see details   so they ca nt deliver it  yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow  do nt order from amazon
__label__1 we keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed  it takes a  minute cycle  and you just put things in and walk away  it has nt damaged anything vs sanitizing in the washing machine  and i do nt have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers  we ve even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes  etc to periodically clean them  i think it s great
__label__1 i received this in a speedy manner  and it was in great condition  i would buy from this person again
__label__1 i needed an extra battery  this whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone  in addition to the battery  you get a standard camera case  retail   and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry  cameras  accessories  and the portable canon printer  there is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal
__label__0 boring  tasteless and unoriginal  photographer has an obvious fixationwhich has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast  tone  and line  one star for the big you know what  the real model here  i m sure book has its merits  but they are nt artistic  putting my copy up for sale
__label__1 dr mark albion is a consistent and heartfelt seemingly lone  sometimes voice of responsibility and truth in what s often a cynical  clutching corporate world  i was energized by his first book   making a life  making a living  ml   and empowered by  true to yourself   albion builds upon the strengths of ml in his most recent title with practical  actionable strategies for transforming your business or career into one of real social value  readers walk away with principles they can start executing tomorrow  and a recalibrated moral compass by which to measure their progress  and albion lives it  while admittedly starting out with some privilege  he bravely walked away from a tenured position at harvard business school  simply unheard of  to follow his heart  to this day  albion continues to shun the easy money  and lives his life by the values he preaches  you can practically count on one hand the number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk  whether it be the insatiable drive for  more   or just the rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday  any business can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings  if you feel like you ve lost your way  or just need some inspirational words ahead of that next challenge   true to yourself  is the book for you
__label__0 i bought this cd for one song   quot  walk awayquot  which was one of their best known songs  i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems  there wasnt  the rest of the album is like an anticlimax  i would suggest a greatest hits instead  if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
__label__0 i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i could nt get a consistent reading  the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless   very disappointed   i returned it without even the box
__label__0 add another e error code complaint to the list  i purchased the camera about a year ago  and have had the e error for about the last  months  the camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all  just beep at you and give you an error code e i ve tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist  nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots  canon wants nothing to do with the fix  and estimates repairs between  and  save the headaches  and buy another camera from a different manufacturer
__label__1 what a great upbeat book that still covers the struggles of a child of a divorced family  living in poverty  and being of a mixed race  great great read with a great ending that was nt to unbelievable  it left you with a good feeling even though the struggles of the children were very real  great life lessons as well as cultural lessons in this book
__label__1 my son was over  before we introduced be videos  there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images  but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot  as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons  unlike some of the other be s with random visuals  here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired  concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features  it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons  and no i did nt care for the commercial either
__label__1 if your a fan of progressive rock  you probably already know how good this cd is  in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time  followed closely by operation mindcrime  any of the great pink floyd and rush records  my only complaint on this dvd  is the sound  i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great  somewhere  it did nt transfer to the recording  it is not the worst thing i have ever heard  but it does nt show the bands power live  every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price  i would not want to be with out it
__label__0 while i love billie  in her own words  these sessions were dull  and uninspired  since the reviews should focus on one cd  that is the jist of it  boring renditions  and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection
__label__0 maybe it s just my bad luck  but i ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery  i called amazon  and they sent me a replacement quickly  the thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same not working condition  the same problem with the battery  i was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item  as amazon vendor do nt check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers  be aware  do nt waste your time
__label__1 i have always like stephen lynch  his video  live at the elray  was absolutely awesome  i even gave one to my cousin this christmas  defintely worth the price
__label__1 before purchasing this product i did the trial of photoshop for  days and then the trial of this one  paint shop pro  psp  won hands down  while they both have similar features  the learning curve on photoshop is ridiculouspsp is so intuitive  you can figure out most of the features on your won  but the help feature is greatside by side help as you click through the menus and buttons  i was impressed  the redeye fix is excellent and flexible  with ability to change to pet eye  different eye colors  wow  there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed  i have restored some antique photos with very impressive results  so far i have not had the instability issues that others cite  but my pc is heavy on the graphics capability and memory  perhaps that helps
__label__0 with the caliber of musicians playing on this album  i expected a hard hitting original  instead we get rearranged covers and lots of  filler  salsa  no surprises here  the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious  you ll play this one once
__label__1 thoroughly enjoyed the cd  have some of the songs as performed by other artists  but it s nice to hear them as performed by the writer  i m always impressed by one with that kind of creativity
__label__0 after years of using symantec norton antivirus and related internet security products  the upgrade to  seemed like a no brainier  that was until the install started  if you run into error    you may as well give up  it is over  following the symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded    error caused the entire windows xp install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation  believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing symantec i marched forward  once xp was installed and current with the patches it was time to install symantec again  no luck  i was still receiving the    error  now it was time to get someone on the phone for support  this is a good trick since symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support  the number by the way is  be prepared for a long wait on hold  during four support calls i experienced no less that  minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour  support is provided by offshore resources in india so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier  the four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs  prep for install  reboot  reinstall  hack through the registry  and oh yah corrupt windows xp again needing a second reinstall  during the final call  the support rep finally gave up and indicated the symantec could not be installed on this windows xp machine  i have since moved on to mcafee internet security suite  the install took about ten minutes and i am now up and running again
__label__1 the case for faith  is the weakest volume in a strong series  strobel s format is fun and engaging  i find his books as  unputdownable  as any blockbuster pageturner  strobel holds a degree from yale law school  and he was an awardwinning legal editor at the chicago tribune  he begins with a question   does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus  does current science support the existence of a creator god  does it make sense to have faith in god   and then travels north america  interviewing acknowledged  academic experts on the question at hand  some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest   but  strobel s books are nt fair  because he only presents one side   perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books  titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books  the first three words of each title is   the case for   no  strobel is not presenting the case against his topic  he does nt represent himself as doing so  our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly  why should strobel waste paper and time doing that  when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing  strobel s accounts of his interviews of the experts are always readerfriendly  but he never talks down to his reader  if you do nt want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing  but want to get to the nub of the issue  strobel is your man  these techniques worked excellently in  the case for a creator  and  the case for christ   but less well in  the case for faith   there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book  these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks  in the introduction  strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton  templeton presents a righteous  enraged case against god  and then  tearfully  admits how much he continues to adore jesus  and  indeed  to miss him  this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a lovehate relationship with their creator  in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one  which addresses the question of suffering  strobel s friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car  this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith  even in the face of profound suffering  in another brief passage  strobel tells of his friend ron bronski  who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister  these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book  they were the most rewarding to read  the formal interviews with the experts did nt do a lot for me  and some were alienating  norman geisler s treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns  it may be true that in war  children are killed with their adults   when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults   but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey  too  there is doubt  if not complete disbelief  among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place  see israel finkelstein   the chapter entitled  church history is littered with oppression and violence  was especially weak  compared to other treatments of the same material  strobel s treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper s work  strobel does nt handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all  the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact  and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter  nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon  the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross  scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace  weak  christian ideas about humanity s unity as god s children and the value of all life  this is not made clear enough in strobel s account  all in all  i have to say i ve encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books  and yet  strobel is such a good writer  and his technique is so engaging  that you could do worse than to read this book  read the other two books in the series first  though
__label__0 i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past  years  i was born  raised in the north  i think evans should rename his book  fiddler on the roof in the south   his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history  as it was in the past here  it s very much  the southern jews were all so happy  they all fit in and were accepted  etc he does cite a few instances where they had problems  but these usually involved us  yankee jews   like the instances when a few  yankee  rabbis in the south fought for civil rights  evans should realize that times have really changed here  the evangelical christians in my town  which is most people here  harrass me like crazy   i am praying for you    have you read the words of jesus  who was a jew like you    when will you come to my church  blah  blah  blah  thank god for the minority of catholics  methodists  presbyterians and a few others who live here  they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am  and the way i will stay  a jew  i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience  jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences  and that they cannot relate to what i am saying  but i do want to ask evans a few questions    if things are so great for the jews in the south  why have you lived in new york for decades now      why do nt you at least write either a new forward to the book  a magazine article  etc  contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time  for some of us at least   primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians  i read evans  books before i moved here  and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here  for a jew who really cares about her  his religion living here is depressing  it is practically jewless  and  at best  the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me   by the way  i am planning to move to a city   by the way  do nt bother writing to me to tell me that i am  wrong   or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church  believe me  with all the praying for me that is going on in this town  and all the myriad attempts to convert me  if it has nt happened by now  as they say in these parts  it just ai nt gonna happen
__label__1 the price was the best i could find  ordering was hassle free and delivery was fast
__label__0 i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them  hr taxcut included all i needed and was    the price
__label__1 read the reviews and picked the elephant for my m old child s nusery  i absolutely love it  before this  my son could not sleep well with our  family s  humiifier because it was too noisy  within an hour of bringing this home  it was set up  very easily  and he took one of many     hour naps that week  no filters  no noise  no problems thus far  i did have it on high for the first  mins and found a puddle of water underneath  but the humidifier was near a window  and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top   the problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop  filling it is a snap and the very fine mist  looked like small stream of fog  was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal  the tank seems to last longer than the box states  it is on it s third day on a low  med setting and it still only has a  inch difference at the top  i love the safety features and i do nt have to worry about the tank still on if it s empty since it has an automatic shut off  the light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room  it is a design that will last thoughout his childhood  thank you crane

__label__1 stars to the film itself  here s a painful study of a woman s descent to lunacy amidst a desolate  uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste  the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski s repulsion but dwells on vitti s being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve s intensive plunge to schizophrenia  the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director s works  one of his greatest works  lavventura remains his best to me   the only problem is the dvd transfer  i ve seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange  the dvd  although sharper and clearer  fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots  for a film that essentially deals with color  it was antonioni s first color feature   the transfer was rather clumsy and careless  the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement  why did nt criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film

 theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these      philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language     ambition is the death of thought  these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome years ago  but most people have yet to find this out  dennett  though he has been a philosopher for some years  is one them it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist  john searle  studied under famous wittgensteinians  searle with john austin  dennett with gilbert ryle  but searle got the point and dennett did not  dennett is a hard determinist  though he trys to sneak reality in the back door   and perhaps this is due to ryle  whose famous book  the concept of mind     continues to be reprinted  that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine  dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein  ryle  andmany others since  have exposed in detail  byaccident  just before this book  i had read  the minds i   which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in  they made some bad mistakes  see my review   and saddest of all  they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess nagels   what is like to be a bat   and an early version of john searles  chinese room argument explaining why computers do nt think nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat s mind would be like searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does  eg  it can translate chinese without understanding it   likewise  we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad or just intelligible  for many philosophical and scientific concepts our use of the words consciousness  choice  freedom  intention  particle   thinking   determines  wave  cause  happened  event  and so on endlessly   are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy  and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved   chaos reigns wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this  unfortunately  he died inhis prime  his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind  language  worksand he never wroteany popular books  so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few  searle is one of the world s leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books  some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennetts workhis review   consciousness explained away  of dennetts  book   consciousness explained  and his book the mystery of consciousness  are very well known  and show  in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing  why neither dennett  nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic  havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem ie  how do you conceptualizeconsciousnessmany suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things  but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attackssearle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is  mostly  a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for  years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious  thinks  etc   he just points out that we do nt have any idea how this happens  searle characterizes as  intellectualpathology   the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book  where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how   unsurprisingly  there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire bookthere arehowever  many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is like most people  it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world  they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years agowittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the  s  and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with dennett says  p  that his view is compatibilism  ie  that free will  whichi hopewe can equate with choice  is compatible with determinism  ie  that there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future p   he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity however  the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice  in the sense we normally understand it  disappears and we are left with   choice    which is something we cannot choose naturally  this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book   consciousness explained    it is remarkable that  at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works  or how an atom works for that matter   that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote    and whats more  this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent  because  insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see  the limits of human understanding   theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these    the relation between language   thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost if one is very  very careful  some understanding is possible  but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand there are at least  different topics here  evolution of our brain  choice and morality  and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms there is  however  no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms  or his favorite example  the game of life running on a computer  are isomorphic with reality he knows that quantum indeterminacy  or the uncertainty principle  is a major obstacle to determinism however defined  and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom  but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with by extension   its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain  so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain  whatever that may be   however  the universe is a big place and its been around a long time  perhaps forever  and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state the notion  there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future  cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes  he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice  this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness  or any other emergent phenomenon   if so  they will definitely win at least one nobel prize  for not only will they have explained consciousness  they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence  how higher order properties emerge from lower ones   so  they would have to solve the  easy  problem  to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over timeignoring uncertainty  and the  hard  one  what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc    and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain  it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable  even for one atom or a vacuum  as it would require an infinite amount of computer time  but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer  he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls  but physics is made of notions just as fantastic  uncertainty   entanglement  wave  particle duality  schrodinger s dead  alivecat etc  and as feynmann said many times   nobody understandsphysics    many think nobody ever will  on pg  he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg  to that our personality differences are due to how our  robotic teams are put togther  over a lifetime of growth and experience     this is a bald dismissal of human nature  of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood  and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism  on page  he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference  but for whom   nobody but philosophers we make choices what s the problem   one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem what are consciousness   pain   yellow  intention  matter  quarks  gravity etc   i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice this shows that there is something strange about such questions wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc  and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode decoupled modes permit thinking about the past  planning for the future   guessing the mental states of others  etc  but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think   john will try to steal my wallet   rather than just imagining that john might do it  confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode  enter the realm of pathology some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way they lose control of which mode they are in  eg  notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have  one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode normal mode eg  what is that lion doing  was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next evolved later this was probably never a problem for animals any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically  could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes hence  we have philosophy and this book  which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode   let us alter wittgenstein s quote to read   as longas there continues to be a verb  to decide  that looks as if it functions in the same way as  to eat  and  to drink   as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action  of saying i wish i had done otherwise  etc  etc  people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up   as withmost philosophy books  nearly every page   often every paragraph  changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story  etc  and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world on page  he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives  like we count on food and water  but who ever  outside philosophy  standing in front of lunch counter full of food  ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water   even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode  i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones  this is not a trivial observation    the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in  year old children so i would say that normally  nobody counts on having choice   but rather we just choose on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice   and that   it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct  as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic  but it is not    and on page   it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs  the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning  deciding  promising   resenting   etc  but that these are builtin functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood there is no evidence that they change as we grow  or are in any way subject to our beliefs  only that they mature just as our body does on pg  he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it  do we believe we see an apple  feel a pain  are happy   the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca nt meaningfully then say that we still believe it  except as a joke etc   the inference engine can run in decoupled  belief   mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them  but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice but dennett is saying thisis the universal case if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else consciousness   seeing  thinking  etc if we take this seriously  and he says  the serious problems of free will   then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life  then madness is minutes away   on page  et seq   he discusses causation  intention and the  informal predicates  that we use to describe atoms etc  but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents  ie animals or people or things like them ie  ghosts or gods  are involved we use our concepts  engines  for agency  intuitive psychology  social minds  etc to decide how to behave there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines  depending on the precise situation  discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics   agency  ontological categories etc of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein s many incisive comments on causation  intention  deciding  nor of searle s now classic works on intention and social reality  he spends much time on ainslie s book  breakdown of will   in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties  ie  inference engines  by which we evaluate probable outcomes  hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism  emotion and economics  but the book he cites was  years old when this book was published  it was bingham s idea  amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson    that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising indeed they are  and in fact they are standard parts of economic  evolutionary and cognitive theory  but unfortunately   he makes little reference to the other work in these fields  all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them  he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice onpg  he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will  and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities  but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters   dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text again  he gets things backwards  as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self  but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines as he notes  hundreds of experiments with the prisoner s dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people s choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious  they are much slower and less reliable  so  there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought  dennett says  we make ourselves  so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results if we or others do not we feel guilt  outrage  resentment etc   then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolvedour genes make us so we ca nt  mostly  do otherwise  not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it  we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices these intuitions evolved in small groups between    and some millions of years ago in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world  on pg  he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as  a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making  from certain angles     he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some  unspecified   properties possessed by traditional free will the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice he insists  top pg   that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility  but making ourselves so we could nt do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function   nor does it seem to leave any room for morality  as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise  he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so normally if someone asks us to move our hand  we know what counts as having a choice   but  typical of philosophers   i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position  at this point he also starts his discussion of libet s well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time  on page  et seq   he sneaks in his definition of conscious will the  brains user illusion of itself  which has as one of its main roles providing  me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times    and   illusory or not  conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action     he says the trick we need is to see that   i    control what is happening inside the  simplification barrier   where decision making happens    mental events  become conscious by  entering into memory   the process of self description is what we are  the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space  the brain  and time  memories   he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous  everyone who can follow this and really understands     i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors   some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness  and the real self  out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced    many will say he took the words out of their mouth  but i would say it s incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe  making the obvious extensions of such claims  was gone long beforewegot this far on pg  he says that culture has made us rational animals  this is a stunning denial of human nature  ie  genetics and evolution  coming from the person who wrote  darwin s dangerous idea   presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space  the brain and other people  and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness  line  from bottom   he says consciousness is a userinterface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain  you will have to suffer through  consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either   though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology  he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades  social mind  intuitive psychology  coalitional intuitions etc  and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts  if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture  thats ok  but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes  we are also told here that rd  by which he means evolution here  but other things elsewhere  has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality  i am sure that he will get little agreement on this  it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates  and earlier  long before spoken language  though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain   he continues   morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago   which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake  and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes  which is an amazing  and totally incorrect  thing to say  even if he was only referring to memes  on pg  he claims that because we do not comprehend our  bland dispositions to cooperate    they mean nothing to us  but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being  eg  autism   i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think  he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them  this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology  i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions  like all the templates  are accessible to consciousness  we may decide our cheating was justifiable  or forgive someone else s cheating  but we still know it was cheating  ie  we cannot change the engine   i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings  another issue is that as culture developed  one had to make many important or  moral type  decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer  on pg  he says that we now replace our  free floating rationales   probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines  with reflection and mutual persuasion  and on pg  he says that it is a child s upbringing  demanding and giving reasons  that affects moral reasoning  again  he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last  years of research the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing  we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self  which takes responsibility  it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition  on pg  he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education  memory  and sharing  it s clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments  on pg  he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between  oughtand  is   unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago ie  they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people  he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes  eg see  the blank slate    he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology  but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion  this happens on pg  where he states that concepts like  praiseworthy  were shaped over millennia by culture  while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms  on pg  he tries to explain how an ess  evolutionarily stable strategy  can produce morality  his idea here is that genetic  rd  produces dim understandings of morals and then culture  memetics  produces variations and clarifications  i would say that we all know  and much research has made clear  that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases  culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings  the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore  which i started reading  years ago since it s authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us but  there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book  there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy  and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho s  books than anywhere in philosophy  one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities there is no sign here  nor in anything he has done  that dennett is morally superior after  years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them  it seems clear that  like all of us  he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines  so  how much opportunity is there to improve our morality   it seems clear  eg  see pinker s  the blank slate   that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment  in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties  on average  maybe  of the variation in moral behavior  variations are the only thing we can study  is due to our own efforts the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect  how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is  and if one did  we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking  coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is  and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first  to return to the quote at the beginning  ambition is the death of thought  indeed though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
__label__1 if you re a professional photographer  you can probably ignore this review  but then you probably wo nt be thinking about buying this lens anyway  as you ll be off to purchase a nice l series  however  if  like me  you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera  or equivalent  and enjoy taking decent pictures  this lens will probably work out very well for you  i ve taken well over  pictures with it in a couple of weeks  and it has performed very much as expected  for the price  it s perfect for a goeverywhere lens  a few main points  okay  it s not the best image quality  even on low  medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses  it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit  but for welllit outdoor shoots it s works very well  of course  it would be nice to have a nice l series with is  but if you ca nt afford that then this is a very good value lens  not for the real professionals  but great if you do nt take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom  and  let s face it  who does nt want a but more zoom

__label__1 a recent dallas morning news column profiling td jakes quoted a university of houston sociology professor saying that jakes is  incredible in how he s able to diagnose people s pain  he has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition   jakes  new book hemotions illustrates the verity of the professor s statement  in hemotions  jakes nails the issues and challenges christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams  jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor  father  husband and entrepreneur  in the opening pages  he describes his motivation for writing   i want to share what i ve learned  i want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man  not in some touchyfeely group hug kind of way but in an honest  soulbearing way  which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love   jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book  not only does he address male readers  but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men  jakes  noholds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life  jakes writes about his childhood  his ministry  his family and his ups and downs in lifealways tying stories to life lessons for readers  it does not take the reader long to discern that jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture  jakes writes that  a man must value himself   hemotions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselvesregardless of their circumstances  he encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life s journey  the book is written as if jakes is in the room having a oneonone talk with the reader  if it was in fact such a talk  it would surely involve laughing  weeping  praying and dreaming  one such example of the conversational style is when jakes writes about balancing family and career  he writes   i m here to tell you that if you do nt contain your work life and segregate it from your home life  then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a lifethreatening forest fire   there is not an area of discussion where jakes lets men off the hook  he writes authoritatively about power  money and sex  in the financial arena  jakes commands readers   stop asking god to bless an area where you refuse to obey his word for your life   in one relationship area after another  jakes  writing leads the reader to selfexamination  awareness  forgiveness and improvement  his writing on subjects such as a man s relationships with his father  children  wife  other men  time  money and god is honest and down to earth  it is also practical  as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter  throughout the book  jakes references the life of david to shed light on the above relationships from a biblical perspective  jakes encourages readers that  someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life   this book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships  i encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights jakes shares in this book

__label__0 i did nt enjoy the film  i also did nt enjoy the original play by shakespeare  king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays  i do nt consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done  and to add nothing of value to the original  you can set it wherever you like  in medieval japan or on the moon  what s the difference  it s king lear  a downer of a play  there s nothing great about ran just as there s nothing great about lear  and it takes up three hours of your time  a moron named lear  or hidetoro  or whatever his name is  relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son  the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father  he is right  of course  and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily  he s wanted dead or dead  in this treatment of the annoying plot  he loses his mind  he has a faithful follower or two  they overact  there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play  lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk  am i supposed to care what happens to him  why  because he used to be a powerful king  and a cruel one  you may as well cry over saddam hussein  look at this movie with fresh eyes  look at shakespeare s king lear with fresh eyes  this stuff simply is not very entertaining  and is not very good  the hell with king lear  he s an annoyance

__label__0 well folks  looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here    crash  comes close  but that film has a lot more detractors than this one  and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined  somehow  that it would  change the world    my beefs are not the same as most of those who do nt like the film  i do nt much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse  nor do i find it overly depressing  fact is  it is nt depressing at all cause i did nt care  it s just boring and annoying  sometimes at different moments  sometimes simultaneously  this not a good combination  all right  here s a plot summary  jared leto  marlon wayans  jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs  and this really messes up their lives  i hate to give it all away like that  but there it is  the fundamental flaw is this  i do nt like any of these people  so their pain does nt mean anything  and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect  maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would ve worked  but now there just is nt anything there  as far as what s actually in the movie  we ve got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly  who wants to be a fashion designer  or something  beyond this we ve got jared s mother  ellen burstyn  who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto s friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues  i particularly love how there s no real attempt to make wayans into a person  he s got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that s it  the doubly sad fact is that he s the most likable of the three  he at least displays a little life  connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it s a wonder that the smack does nt cause them to cease to exist entirely   well  connelly actually does coke  i think  but it fails to liven her up any  also  i actually like the bergman films i ve seen  so that s not really a fair comparison   they love each other  apparently  but since i do nt even like either of them i m not much interested  finally  burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end  perhaps it would nt have been funny if i cared about her  but we ve been over that  and i want you people to know that i m not utterly heartless when it comes to movies  i can care about the characters  but none of these people did anything for me  so the movie s dead in the water  for good counter examples watch  trainspotting   which has drugaddict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and  bubba hotep   a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly  times better than this film despite being a silly horrorcomedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it  on the other hand  neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as  requiem for a dream   so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego  still  if that s all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose   requiem for a dream  is nt helped any by darren aronofsky s repetitive  derivative overdirection  the trouble is  this movie has nt got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is  there s nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics  but they re hopelessly driven in to the ground  as we see fastmotion a thousand times  quickcut montages a million times and plenty of wonky cameraattachedtotheactor junk  and they are  again  impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai nt drawing me in  i imagine that the overdone  repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use  but that does nt make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch  the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over  truth be told  i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half  but then it really started to grate on me  it became evident that no  aronofsky was nt going to introduce any new visual tricks and no  these characters were nt going to get any more interesting  i looked at the timer continuously for about the last  minutes of the film  and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective  it was kind of uplifting  really  now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else  now that s a good ending  grade  d ps this is  reviews  i doubt if i will write  more  but who knows

__label__0 i have enjoyed many of mark s novels  do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch   all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer  every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice all of them  and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters  his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older  there is frequent repetition and redudancy  characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times  though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice  which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide   his characters always  and i mean always  mate for life  which is a beautiful romantic ideal  but ultimately can get tiresome  gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment   all that said  at his best  dykwik  a better life  keeper of secrets  mark roeder writes a compelling and often unputdownable story  but in outfield menace  the bad most definitely outweighs the good  did mr roeder do any research into the time period    the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel  if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens  who do nt realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time   but if you want to set a novel in the fifties  do nt have a lead male character with a ponytail  no one  but no one  wore a pony tail in the fifties  and certainly not in a small midwest town   do nt have characters use anachronisms like  fifteen minutes of fame   and most of all  do nt have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys  mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing  he has apparently made a name for himself  and some money i d guess   and i must confess  i ve bought his novels  glutton for coming out stories that i am  but no legitimate house would publish his novels  at least not without major editing and rewriting  something that a self published author  especially one with an apparently inflated self image  goes without  there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two  major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe  m or f   the hookup artist  rainbow road  boy girl boy  read them  if only to see how these truly outstanding  and published by legit houses  novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two  if you must read roeder  then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep  memo to roeder  if you want to write about a time you do nt know about  do your research

__label__1 according to charles kimball  religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth  religion inspires humans to transcend their selfinterests  while at the same time  more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution  using a comparative religious approach  kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil  kimball argues the word  religion  is amorphous and difficult to define  as a result  the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary  one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions  kimball  next  asks if religion is the cause of evil  and he answers both yes and no  a religion that is arrogant  condescending  and requires adherents to  disconnect their brain  is problematic  on the other hand  religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community  kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil  the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims  when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine  the propensity towards evil increases dramatically  sacred texts  sources of wisdom and guidance  become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims  christianity and islam have missionary mandates  but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims  kimball argues for a  human view of truth   one that is dynamic and relational  allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions  another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience  when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities  when a charismatic leader demands total obedience  has unrestricted power  and has total control  religion is unhealthy  uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy  as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection  strict segregation from the larger society  combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous  kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence  every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth  while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future  when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time  the likelihood for disaster increases  many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society  zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status  and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind  kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god s agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous  religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means  when one theological component gets elevated  thus becoming an end  and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end  all religions have notions of sacred space  but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space  reinforcing or protecting group identity against an  other   or protecting group identity from within the group  are also potentially dangerous signs  institutional structures develop in all religious traditions  but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end  kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends  the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a  holy  war  kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity  and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of  islam is a peaceful religion  which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order  the word jihad means  struggling in the way of god   but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense  with rules similar to the christian just war theory  because of socioeconomic disparities  some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends  and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause  kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy  with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil  religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis  faith  hope  and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents  so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted  against secularism  kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the timetested wisdom and ethical standards  and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity  with religious diversity christians have three options  exclusivism  inclusivism  and pluralism  but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity  finally  the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community  if peaceable solutions are not found in the arabisraelipalestinian

__label__1 my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it  from a novice s point of view  this is a great meditation aid  i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself  i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me  it s also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack
__label__0 i thought the movie was alright  but i am sorry that i bought it  i would rather have just rented it  it seems like half of the movie is out of focus  i am sure it is on purpose but i just do nt get it  there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
__label__1 this shaver replaced a norelco advantage   years old  that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days  i ca nt honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because i have nt shaved with a blade in many years  i have used foil shavers in the past  braun and panasonic  and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it  i have been using this shaver for about  months  during that time i have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day  at first i thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought was doing a great job  it shaves quick and close  personally i think as close as a blade   when you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry  it does nt get any easier than that  i have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too  the only con is i have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the  comfort settings  use electric shave before shaving and i think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation  highly recommended and worth the price

__label__0 for average people who want a camera that just worksand takes good pics you should not buy this  i do nt know about the specifics  but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months  so  i do nt really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does nt even take a picture  it was fine while it worked  it ate batteries but the pics were good
__label__1 this book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga  from beginner to advanced  the content is concise and practical  and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice  there are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga  the introduction is especially valuable  as it offers a no fluff indepth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice  i pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly  years of owing it  my copy is dog eared and loved  and was well worth every penny  an earlier reviewer mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly  and only gave the book two stars  which is a shame  this book was first printed in the mid  s  over  years ago  it was the first yoga book of it s kind to ever be printed  and it s content is timeless and as relevant today as ever  mr iyengar even had to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so many photos  as it was so expensive in those days to print such a book  i say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long before it was ready  he s a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft  and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just because it does nt come in some glossy package fit for the masses
__label__1 these came yesterday and i started using them right away  i was able to learn  for recognition only   new jlpt kanji in under  minutes so this product is definitely worth it  before using this i learned all jlpt kanji by writing it over and over again on scratch paper  that was a more thorough method but ive decided that for now  recognition is more important than writing so wrp flashcards are a big help  as others have noted  they have a nice look and feel to them  all nihongo students should have this in their arsenal  you ll definitely have an advantage over fellow classmates who waste valuable time making their own flashcards

__label__1 i ve always preferred wordperfect to word  i find it is easier to use  more intuitive  and allows more control over documents  it is less buggy  and i have yet to find one thing that word does better than wp  this new version of wp is even better than the old  and i can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from word  word users should find this version especially easy to switch to  since it can be made to look and act like word  though why anyone would want that  i do nt know   underneath the surface  though  it is still wp  which means it is stable  you can see codes in your document and manipulate them  and it wo nt do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you do nt want and ca nt control  i have been using wpx heavily since i got it  but i still have nt used all the features  i am especially looking forward to trying its pdf conversion function  i also have nt used any of the other programs in the suite yet  but if prior versions are any indicator  they will also be easy to use and powerful

__label__1 this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy  a year after this book was published  there were over a hundred reviews  regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author  finds the author right or wrong  interesting or boring  this book is one of the most influential books  if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy  in fact  the current bush adminstration s policies  george kenan s containment  henry kissinger s policies as well as countless adminstration s policies are shaped or affected by this book  my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments  and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book  it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations  differing on extent   i studied the policies first and read the book the year after   it is a fascinating book and hard to put down  the author writes in a european style  beautiful long sentences  etc   which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my costudents makes it more difficut to read  he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically  ms rice and mr kissinger were heavily influenced by this book  to understand them  this is a must read  in and of itself  it is an excellent book  a classic  and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it  look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists
__label__0 written in cartoon format  i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight  dry  biography of scientists  however  it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids  the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known  so using it as an initial reading is impossible  further  some content is offensive  on the second page of cartoons  a scientist is walking along a bridge  thinking  when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump  saying   no woman is worth committing suicide over   the pictures show a scantilyclad woman  with bare bottom in one frame  that he is now picturing in his mind  irrelevant and inappropriate  plus  i did nt have to go far to find swear words in the captions  yikes  my kids will never see this book  it is not even appropriate for highschool age kids   in fact  it is nt even funny to adults

__label__1 i had two choices watching this moviesmile or laugh out loud  when i was nt smiling i was laughing  keaton s the general is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered  the story line is simple  but what keaton does with it is genius  johnny gray  buster keaton  is an engineer for the western and atlantic railroad  he has two loves  his engine  the general  and annabelle lee  marion mack   a fine southern belle  when war starts  johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected  he s more valuable to the south as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier  trouble is  nobody tells him why he was rejected  worse  annabelle thinks he may be a coward  and tells him she does nt want to see him again until he is in uniform  just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the general and take it north  destroying bridges and lines along the way  while a northern army moves south  unknowingly  annabelle lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped  johnny sees the general chugging away and races after it  determined to bring back the general  when he realizes annabelle lee is held captive  his resolve knows to bounds  for the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest  fastest  funniest chase movies ever filmed  keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny  but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point  and when he rescues annabelle and realizes how hopeless her southern belle helplessness can be  his exasperation is matched only by his love  the general features a big cast  a major battle  fleeing armies  a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge  keaton s timing and inventiveness are legendary  so is his risktaking  he does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous  in one  he is lying back on the engine s cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward  in the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks  keaton has another railroad tie in his hands  at the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as keaton on the cow catcher passes  this scene has no cutting  the two ties fly off as high as keaton s head  he could have been killed  instead we laugh  it s amazing that in his older years keaton could still walk  his body took incredible punishment for the laughs  try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties  his ingenuity is extraordinary  how do you build excitement out of an extended train chase  both engines are behemoths and are on the same track  they ca nt pass each other  keaton does it with endless bits of business  in fact  he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and splitsecond timing  what makes keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he does nt do doubletakes  he barely reacts  but he s no stoneface  keaton s characters are simply very serious fellows  things happen to them  his characters do nt react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions  this edition of the general comes from kino video and looks good  it includes two keaton short films  the playhouse    and cops     in the playhouse  keaton portrays all the members of the cast  orchestra and audience in a stage show  including nine members of a minstrel act  the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp  in cops  he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another
__label__0 the leather case has a magnetc latch  the magnetic force is strong enough for an sd card to stick onto it  i have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire  but i decided not to chance it  i am surprised that canon cautions against placing the camera in strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature  although constructed of fine leather  the case is also very bulky  making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse  the neck strap is ok  it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing  making it look quite cheap and stiff  again increasing the bulk of the camera  the battery works fine  but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money

__label__0 after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory  this sequel was an absolute letdown  the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie s  formerly wonka s  chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth  while beyond the reaches of earth s atmosphere  our heroes charlie  grandpa joe  and mr wonka must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids  pronounced  knids    aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes  far worse than these beasties  though  are the insufferable old folks whose twentyyear stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless  charlie  joe  and wonka  with no help from charlie s folks or other grandparents  save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory  where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills  returning them to infancy or beyond  charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites  who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters  at the end of the novel  the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president  in short  these three are the most tedious  spiteful  unredeemable characters i ve come across in children s literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompaloompas as i read this book  as it is  they  unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory  learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last  their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore  rather than a joy  to read

__label__0 i was extremely disappointed with  after midnight   the author  his widow  has written the book from her own life s perspective  and there is sadly little about the true brad davis  his homosexuality  or perhaps bisexuality  is mentioned only in passing  and anyone in new york or hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life  i guess a book written by his wife ca nt be expected to delve too deeply into this area  but even other interesting details  his drug addiction  his acting technique  etc are only minimally suggested here  i wanted to put the book down after two chapters  but kept waiting for it to get interesting  i suggest the publishers retitle the book  my life with brad davis  the saga of a wife kept in the dark   or something similar  to indicate to readers that this book is about susan bluestein  and tells very little about brad

__label__0 bought this as an xmas present to myself  to bring along family photos while on business travel  i m now on the nd unit  exchanged directly w  phillips   and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external  in my case  sony memory sticks   the internal memory is pitiful  and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it  you are not going to be able to hold very many internally  i ve yet to get the auto on  off feature to work  and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device  it s certainly not always mac friendly  the controls are cumbersome to work with  and the directions meager  i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag  the fact that the support stand ca nt be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this  of course  no mention of this in the product description  also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks  no support for the new  ms produo sticks  and no mention of that in the product descriptions either  i thought i would get a quality product from phillips  and this certainly looked like it had potential  unfortunately  it s turned out to be a piece of junk  one i ve been screwing around with for so long that it s probably not returnable  do nt waste your time and dollars

__label__0 i bought this item as a gift  and it ended up becoming mine  i have to say  i am greatly dissatisfied  here are some main issues i am having with the camera   it is very poorly designed  the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant  buttons are really ugly  and operating the camera is awkward  and for some functions requires both hands to operate   the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally   the worst  by far  is the picture quality  colors are just plain terrible  automatic settings are a disaster of photography  i have used a canon  mp  before getting this one  mp   the canon was far superior in quality  colors  lighting  i do nt need large files of trash  i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures  as a result  i am strongly recommending getting a different camera  i have had great experiences with canon  and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too  but hp must stop making cameras  and indeed many other devices

__label__0 old spice is a greatsmelling cologne and i ve worn it for years  my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it  it s a great cologne for lean  athletic guys who love retro  it s been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men  it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff  the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention  otherwise he ll just be annoying  old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time  exposing it to heat helps to age it  leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building   trust me  it smells awesome if you let it age  i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle  i m proud to say i m carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne  it s not nerdy and it s not just for older men  it s a cologne for any masculine guy  it smells great
__label__0 i wanted to buy this for my daughter  i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fillins with my new scrapbooking hobby  the outside is precious  but once you open it  the pages are like a black and white newspaper material  and they have no structure what so ever  the pages are boring and do nt look very durable
__label__0 i agree complete with erik cobbett  this is covenant s most unnecessary and boring album ever  there are a couple of nice parts on it  but generally it s a big disappointment
__label__0 this is not the best way to get started in astronomy  the low power eyepiece is fairly useful  the higher power one less so  and do nt even think of using the barlow  the maximum useful magnification for a mm scope is about x  assuming the objective lens is of good quality  when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope  you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown  to their credit  the manufacturer has provided a reflex  red dot  finder in place of the useless x finders that plague so many similar scopes  even so  what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited  some star clusters will be dimly visible  but galaxies and nebulae will be barely if at all visible  in a way  it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope  their uppertier instruments are quite good  but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this  in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models  just make sure  gentle reader  to stay away from the toys  using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp file and but rather like playing a guitar  it is a learned skill  and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope  buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving  if you want to see the wonders of the sky  contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties  the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started  the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and x binoculars  decent ones are available on amazon   then graduate to something along the lines of a mm     dobsonian  celestron s own   starhopper can be found on amazon for under  for more information on buying telescopes  see my encyclopedic guide on amazon   so you want to buy a telescope

__label__1 this record is a fine example of earnest juju music  other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards  chief commander obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife  keep in mind  this means amazing percussion work  intertwining guitar lines  loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals  if you re interested  you should buy it  it will make you happy  no matter how you were feeling  and what you re doing
__label__0 during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically  the rock  he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest  most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv  his talent in the ring was spoton  and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete  he rarely made a mistake in the ring  but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood  it s not that doom is really a bad movie  sure  it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters  it s just a normal  monstershooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense  and that s it  i m sure the movie would ve been big had it been released  years ago  todays generation is probably sick of gonowhere donothing action films such as doom  okay  so it does go somewhere  but the film is nt really designed to build to an aweinspiring creative story  doom is the kind of movie you do nt really want to seek out  you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick minute action fix  so you rent the movie  watch it  and then forget about it the next morning  of course  i m sure you do nt forget to rewind the tape because that s impolite  the rock never should have left wrestling  it was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans  and the rock means millions  really miss him  come back home  rock  please

__label__0 pure junk  i ve tried this several times  it does nt repair scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk  the first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface  and the second trick is to try to get your money back  the method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers
__label__0 if you want my review in a nutshell  here it is  two defective rise  shine lamps  one call to verilux  verilux refuses to help  if you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass  read on  my verilux product experience  i exchanged my first verilux rise and shine natural alarm clock  bedside lamp due to a nonfunctional internal speaker  ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping  if i am to understand the verilux  company president s response to a similar defect report in these reviews   the good news  the speaker in the second unit now works  and contrary to some of the other reviewers i feel the mylar speaker sounds quite good   although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice  with a linein jack for cd player or ipod   the bad  despite the jumbo lcd display that might lead you to assume that the am  fm tuner is digital  the radio is completely analog  the station ids are printed in roughly point type on the tuning dial instead   small enough that some owners will need their glasses and a magnifying glass to select a radio station  by contrast  i own an alarm clock by conair with a similar analog tuner  with the exception that it uses roughly point lcd digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower righthand corner of the backlit lcd display  on verilux  comparatively enormous lcd  i am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option  an analog tuner without a station display is something i expect from a  drugstore alarm clock  but not from a product of this type  which is otherwise very well thought out  unfortunately  due to an apparent flaw in the shade and  or the lamp itself  the shade on my replacement lamp   the lamp i received from the store in exchange   wo nt sit straight  one can remove the shade  look at the lamp on a level surface  and see the lamp  shelf  slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted  making the situation worse  the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered  there are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down  as typical of most lampshades   the ring  in turn  sits on the lamp body  or shelf   the whole assembly is cockeyed  including the socket into which the bulb sets  at a very obvious angle   cosmetically speaking  there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type  whereas the first lamp i purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the lcd panel  the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf  and it  too  must have been obtained in manufacturing  as for the shade itself  it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish  roughly      that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen  so while the second lamp did not have a doa speaker  i apparently traded one problem in for another  worse  the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room  and would probably appear that way from down the street if i were to set it on the curb   in short  the verilux rise  shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price  warranty suggests  and in case you are wondering if this might have been  gray market  merchandise  it wasnt  i purchased my rise  shine lamp straight out of a highend  authorized retail store  newinbox  the am  fm clock radio paired to the sunrisesimulating fullspectrum light  finished off by the eight highquality digital nature sounds   contained in a spacesaving design roughly   wide at the base and   tall   makes for an outstanding combination and concept  for this reason  i hope verilux will continue to refine the rise and shine model  particularly where quality control is concerned  given that i am a gadget fan  and someone who has rated products   th the price of this lamp very highly  it should be understood that i really wanted to give this a positive review  but two duds in a row  irony the rise  shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer  given that my replacement lamp is also defective  i followed these instructions  but in reality  verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers  problem  not theirs  as per the instruction i received to make a third mile trip back to the store where i purchased it   conclusion  verilux does nt back their warranty  in my experience  opinion   nor  apparently  does verilux care what kind of impression they leave on firsttime customers  so if you think the impressive threeyear warranty will help you if something should go wrong  consider what happened less than  hours into my ownership experience  and believe me  there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of verilux  customer service department  either  what verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the internet  as it so happens  i supplement my income writing product reviews for websites  in fact  i am a writer by training  trade  translation  verilux chose the wrong customer to let down  i have no intention of smearing verilux  reputation   unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such  would i recommend this product to a friend  yesterday i might have said yes  chalking up the nonoperative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke  today  coupled with the fact that verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy  my answer is a resounding no  should anyone at verilux read my review  i wish to close with this thought  i could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems i noted  but a  lampshade  to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box   and does nt sit straight  to boot   is that not worth keeping a firsttime customer happy
__label__0 i do nt recommend this ashtray to anyone  i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in  other people tried besides me  there was no way to contact the company as their website does nt seem to exist anymore  at least i could nt contact them after numerous attempts
__label__1 compared to the energy bars on the market these days  cliff  powerbar  etc  that taste terrible  hooah bars are awesome  they really work too  energy wise  great for long bike rides  triatholons  etc or even something to eat before practice for athletes  they are awesome  i am a huge fan
__label__0 oliver stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a  historian   platoon and born on the fourth of july were great films but jfk  though brilliantly made  was a sign that something was off about stone s mental processes  natural born killers could have been a scathing indictment of our media s obsession with violence and decadencebut instead it s just exhibit a in the indictment  wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize
__label__0 with a good script and a director better suited to the material  i ve read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct   asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson  unfortunately  the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms  a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession  the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist s wife  an excellent natasha richardson  and one of the asylum s patients  an equally good marton csokas   under the watchful eye of the patient s doctor  ian mckellen   there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie  some of which seem quite preposterous  at least in the way the movie was shot  the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson  she does her best in spite of the choppy script  and she even won a best actress award in london for this film  however  as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession  director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job   in fact  i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson  credited as an executive producer  sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out
__label__0 i mostly want a bookstand that would hold a paperback book for me  this cannot do that at all  however  that is not just because it is meant for large books  it ca nt really hold textbooks very well either  the one that i bought ended up in a box in storage  and i doubt i ll ever use it again
__label__1 this item was purchased for casio exilim  megapixel camera  the quality of this item is strong and durable  the camera is small any ways to take with you anywhere by putting it in your pocket  however  to protect the camera  this case provides outstanding protection and is still small and compact to take it with you anywhere
__label__0 like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image  i ve been pleased with the image quality when it works  but from the start it s felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment  sure enough   the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut   sometimes it refuses to start at all   it sometimes powers on as you re putting it into your pocket  which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera   finally  the lcd stopped working altogether  this is after  months  casio has decided i m not under warranty  no explanation as to why  no phone number to argue with them   and is charging me  to repair it  do nt be seduced  it s a poor quality product

__label__0 for nearly   this adaptor provides very little  x  magnification  it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly  this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor  which is used infrequently by me  but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance  it is lightweight  but cumbersome and does nt accept filters  for real telephoto capabilities  get an slr with interchangeable lenses  i sent this product back
__label__0 house of mirth  is one of the most depressing movies i ve ever seen  to be clear  i ve seen movies like  oh  say   schindler s list   or  the heart is a lonely hunter  that treat tragic events  either in the macrocosm or the microcosm  that did not leave me depressed  rather  they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think   house of mirth  deals with tragic themes  including human society s ability to destroy its own  and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites  it was nt  though  moving or thought provoking  i was nt moved by gillian anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor  i did nt believe gillain anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor  rather  i was bored  i kept wanting the film to go faster  it s a great irony  edith wharton s novels are real page turners  quick  to the point  hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality   house of mirth  has gorgeous clothing and sets  i did nt care about anybody onscreen  though  i did nt believe anybody onscreen  i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda  and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces  as if to prove these points  people are hypocrites  see  people are insincere  see  if a person has any decency at all  that person is destroyed  see  i would tend to agree with all of the above points  so  why do i need to watch this movie  also  as a woman  who  as lily bart was meant to  has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that  i felt that this movie  no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally  betrayed lily bart  lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film  she all but participates in her own destruction  you want  just once  for her to show some initiative  some intelligence  some ability to create her own fate  the film denies her those abilities  in this crippling of lily bart  the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does  movies like  gone with the wind  that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning  and occasionally gaining some power  imo  are much easier to watch  one might argue that such films are not realisitic  i do nt know  even we reallife lily barts have our resources  and our triumphs  and  again  watching lily bart in  house of mirth  slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me  it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine
__label__0 i ve purchased seven items from amazon in   so i m not a complete rookie  this item s ad title includes the word  battery  in big  bold letters  i purchased this kit advertised with a  used price   but  condition  new   the ad picture clearly shows a battery  i had looked at several ads and did not read the individual seller s comment  battery missing  in uppercase  though in regular font  to me  a missing part warrants more of a warning than a  comment   that s my  lesson learned   but i still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big  bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing  lesson learned  read the whole ad for the specific seller  especially the  seller s comments
__label__1 this is the text i love the best and it is easy to read and with the words of jesus in red  my only criticism in that the corners of the cover tend to bend  they are made of cardboard which is not as durable as leather  for which i would have paid more  however  it is very good value  and the delivery was as swift as ever
__label__1 this is what music is all about  the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note  or the raspy  delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian  it makes me melt and feel so good and pure  think if tweaker were to make jazz and really chill out this is what it would sound like  you ll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet  ever  there is everything one could want  possibly the perfect record  it s jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul  absolutely brilliant and definitely essential  one of my favorites from the year
__label__1 i really like these things  they re certainly chewy  so they can be a bit of a jaw workout  but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar  and they keep you going for a couple of hours  if only they were a little cheaper  say a dollar or less per bar  i d probably go through them a lot more quickly than i do right now
__label__1 this camera does everything it says  yes  it s waterproof and i was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time   only reason i did nt give it  stars  it is as slow as every other digital camera i ve owned as far as focusing  multiple flashes  and then actually shooting  you get your subject s attention and they smile  frozen  as you hold down the shutter release for a good  seconds until the shot is taken  in low light   i was especially intrigued by its  bright capture  technology  but it honestly does nt seem any different in low light than my old sony u mp tiny little snapshot camera  still that same flashinthedark look  there is a fillflash low light program mode  among many many others   but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob  even if you hold your breath and try to remain still  my ideal snapshot camera is portable  durable  quick  easy  and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes  this camera has  out of those  it is way portable  very durable  easy  produces ok results but you have to mess with settings if you re not in daylight  and it s not very quick  overall i am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere
__label__0 i thought these looked so cute when they came out  so i put it on my wishlist last year  from day one  it has never worked right  sometimes it just shuts off on it s own  of course when you turn it back on you have to start at  again  there is no visible tuner  just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it  the antenna began getting rusty after a few months  finally this morning it broke off in my hand  i was able to stick it back in  but then was nt able to tune a station  i turned it upside down and finally got something  if you want hassle free  ease of use  and good quality  this is not for you
__label__1 the battery is great and it s pretty nice to own two of these  so when one battery is discharged i can just pop in the spare  it was in stock and delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time
__label__1 this album is absolutely fantastic  paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together  paul sounds very loose and like he s having a lot of fun  not as serious as some live shows i ve heard  the songs focus mostly on his solo records  with some jam and style council mixed in  all on disc two   wisely  only five of the twenty three tracks are from  as is now  and they re the uptempo ones  it s not a hard sell by yep roc to make you buy that album if you do nt already have it  the extended jams for  porcelain gods  broken stones    in the crowd  and  foot of the mountain   one of my favorite solo tracks  all are focused and do nt wander so they keep your attention  the crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the jam and style council classics get into the mix  although the singalong to the album closing  town called malice  is pretty lame   i have nt listened to the somewhat difficult to find  live wood  concert disc for a while to give a good comparison  however  since  catchflame  covers all his solo discs instead of only  paul weller  and  wild wood   this is a more balanced collection  highly recommended  personal highlights  blink and you ll miss it up in suze s room porcelain gods  i walk on gilded splinters in the crowd foot of the mountain that s entertainment broken stones long hot summer shout to the to
__label__1 refers to cd recording  after picking up and putting down the book countless times i finally listened to this on cd  the time and attention i did nt have for the print version came easily for the audio recording  guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter  he draws on foundational christian truths  historic and contemporary references  anecdotes  and a solid business acumen  he routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not  eg  vocation  calling  surrender  in unequivocal terms  also  he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify god  everything else in his presentation simply tiesback to this truth  he explains how we get distracted  how others have  and how we can correct our path  again providing examples  and unlike the christianity lite trend in america that often promotes wealth without work or responsibility  guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a christian life  using for example the lives of leonidas  st francis  and bonhoeffer  he also speaks of the joys of a truly godcentered life  i recommend the call to anyone who is listening for their own call  it will help you distinguish between a calling and wishfulfillment  fantasy  acquaint you with others who have heard their call  and inspire you to act  if you ve already heard and responded to your call  you ll recognize guinness as a fellow traveler  this hour presentation was taped live at highland park presbyterian church in dallas  tx usa  the recording includes  audience qa sessions of about  minutes each  these were as informative as the main presentation  often reflecting the very questions i had while listening  recording was produced by wpublishinggroupcom in nashville  tn usa

__label__0 i ca nt believe the touch of bb king  i enjoy his playing immensely  i know this album gets buried in accolades  but i do nt like it  the quality is poor and  differing from other s opinions  the crowd noise takes away from the music  bb said  in so many words  that live at the regal was far from his choice as his best recording  typically  he said he would nt argue with success and left it at that  there are so many good albums by bb you ca nt go wrong for  for the  ultimate collection   sure it does nt have them all but it has quite a few of his great songs  including a few from live at the regal  i would steer clear of this selection  or i ll send you mine for free

__label__0 i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money  i thought this movie was incredibly over acted  boring and hard on the eyes  the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did  they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial  for the superficial people out there i would nt watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you wo nt get it  when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible  i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment
__label__1 this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco  an informer and sleuth  a series of books that have become hugely popular  so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers  it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad  but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop  in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia  a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather  well the weather is best left to its own devices  marcus has lost his heart to senator s daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated  why is that women he is not interested in  fall over themselves to get to him  but the one that he has lost his heart to  treats him with a cool disdain  he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book  falco is not happy  it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again  but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way  will falco ever return

__label__0 the plot of this book was interesting  and it could have been a good book  unfortunately  it wasnt  the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable  and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem  even many of the the secondary characters are weak  miserable people  the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a  dirty little nobody   once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful  he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards  because she is the daughter of a  cit   he ca nt imagine why she has any reservations about the deal  he says charming things to her like  how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway   now that s romance  meanwhile  even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times  she finds herself drawn to him too  for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim  she never stood up for herself  and you felt sorry for her  of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage  only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter  including her  in fact just about the only one who does nt know is the hero  which provides the dilemma  he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really was nt a nobody  will anyone tell him  will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she is nt good enough for him  will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he does nt think she is good enough for him to marry  of course it all works out  and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him  ugh    this could have been a good book if the  mystery  had been handled better  and the characters were written differently  as is  it is a sad regency tale
__label__1 back in the  s and  s  i listened to a really great radio station  wsgs in hazard  kentucky  from my home in flat gap  virginia  and anywhere in the region  it was well known that if you wanted real country music  you simply had to turn on wsgs     watts of pure  monophonic country music  i m not talking about the big hats of nashville  or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days  no  it was the real thing  including local and regional bluegrass  gospel  hiccup preachers  loretta lynn  lefty frizzel  merle haggard  bill monroe  grandpa jones  and countless others  when i listen to this pattly loveless release  i think she must have been listening too  it sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old wsgs  only better  because patty is from our time  and seems to have that old time  mountain shoutitout style much like many of those who came before  she reminds me a bit of wilma lee cooper  what a voice  if you have never heard of these early country artists  and you like the way patty does it up here  it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from  this is the real thing
__label__0 let me start by saying i think the regular guru energy drink is the best on the market  i only wish i could say the same about guru lite  there is nothing positive about this drink  it is awful  i was very excited about trying the lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage  you might as well take a ginseng or ginkgo biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth  if you are big fan of the regular guru stay with it and do nt waste your money on their lite version
__label__0 i wish i d listened to the other reviews  i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me  claims a five year warranty but i ca nt return it to amazon so it s just money wasted  be smarter than me  avoid this product if you value your money
__label__0 man  oh man  i think this is one of the worst books i ve ever read  if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars  i would  seriously  half way through  i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was  boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive  i found the book bizarre  unfocused and poorly written  the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused  the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation  the physics  engineering  psychology  medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic  characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome  only to have them dissipate  and so on  the characters do nt even seem like real people  for example  the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles  and only her ankles  flashing below a curtain  and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are  how could someone know a person that well  but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood  or  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive  as though he really thinks this will attract them  cmon  if the guys a nut  and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking  duck  to them is nuts    write him as a nut the whole way through  do nt make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book s climax  the book s title is nt even explained  for crying out loud  thanatos means death in greek  i believe  but i could never understand what the author  editors  audience thought was dying  i wo nt read this one again  nor will i look for anything else by percy walker
__label__0 i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work  i did nt really have high expectations for it  because it was so inexpensive  as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems    five seconds after i turn it on  it always says  usb connected     and i do nt have a usb cable inserted into it  this also freezes the device  i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial  seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted    i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages  of the manual  my computer does recognize the usb device  but when i try to copy files over to the frame  i get a  path is not found  error    i thought i could live with the above  problems if it could just show my pictures  so i used a card reader to load jpg files onto a cf card at x resolution  when  i plugged the card into the frame  these files show up as  invalid  when i try to view them  emailed coby with the  bullet points above  got a response  hours later saying   coby tech support to me  am   hours ago  hello  we have received your inquiry  it appears that your unit is defective  return the unit to the retailer for an exchange   what an inconvenience and disappointment  i will be buying a different product
__label__1 i did a lot of research before buying this camera  we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price  what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a cm dvdr  finalize the disc on the camcorder  and play it directly on our dvd player or dvdrom player on our computer  we did nt want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv  electrical outlet  and camera to playback footage  and we also did nt want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future  for those of you who like to edit  rerecord  create effects  etc  you need to purchase special software separately  but with a dvdram disc  you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvdrom on your computer  you can also download it with the usb cable  but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started  if you are only interested in playback  dvdr discs are sufficient  however  you ca nt erase or record over footage on dvdrs  only dvdrw and dvdram discs  the picture quality of the camera is adequate  it is nt grainy  but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting  especially outside on a sunny day  it does nt have a builtin light  so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording  i would give the picture quality a  out of  if you want better quality  you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder  considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology  it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy  you ca nt compare it to tv and movie camera quality  but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos  the zoom is good  but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly  the stabilizer is pretty good  but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality  if you plan to move around a lot  use the function  but expect to lose a little quality in the process  what basically happens when using the stabilizer  with most cameras  i believe  is that the image movements are slightly delayed  the sound quality is adequate  but if you are recording when it is windy  you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand  the only problem i have had so far is with the discs  we bought panasonic dvdrw discs and ca nt get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player  we ended up purchasing sony dvdr discs and they play with no problem  when i called panasonic about their dvdrw discs  they did nt have a good answer  the representative told me to make sure the dvdrw discs are compatible with my players  i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player  but it should be with my new computer software  the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is nt any difference between sony and panasonic discs  interesting   they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual  but now i know better  overall  this camcorder is a great value  you ca nt beat the price for this dvd technology   average to good quality picture and functions  is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage  and is really easy to use

__label__1 it took a while to get this product but  it was worth the wait  the iron heats up quickly and easily  when you have arthritis like me  you appreciate the simplicities in this product  it heated up fast and safely and it was so easy to grip the handle  it definitely styled my hair without overprocessing it  thanks
__label__1 i ve been a jim brickman fan for a few years now  when i saw this cd came out  i could not resist getting it  it is absolutely amazing and fully worth it  when i first put it in my stereo  i had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything  that was how impressive they were  the title of the album is incredibly fitting  while my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends  i have this cd turned up in my own little corner to  escape  from it all  i swear i could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit  if you love jim brickman  or just like soft jazz  or piano music  this cd is a must have
__label__0 had this for less than a month and it just stopped heatingthe only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nicebut for the dozen times used it was not worth buyingwill be returning it
__label__1 its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers  it has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it  it shouldnt break  another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer  just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razorit will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me  a man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble  my shaving experience with this thing is pleasantit does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer  the only other device i never had  have that problem with is my braun  complete  parts of the year i shave  other parts of the year i trim   its a very nice package and efficient  the only drawback is that it seems fragileso be careful not to drop any part of this set
__label__0 some scenes are repeated from the first  it is not that bad thats all i can say  i think i over rated it with  stars too many
__label__0 i want this guy to succeed so badly  yet he just could nt pull it off  his voice has a great sound to it  pleasant to the ears  yet his interpretation was just not there  his phrasing was very lazy and boring most times  it seemed like he did nt know where to start the next word  and he also sounded out of breath  he sounded so out of breath that i started gasping for airi had to stop listening  to add to that  john s vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger  i truly hope with age and experience he improves  there s no reason why he should not  he s not in the catagory of a buble  or connick jr yet
__label__0 when i opened the package  i found the filter box seals  one at each side  were broken  an indication that it was not new  i thought it s ok as long as the glass is clean and clear  when i opened the filter box  three pieces  the ring  the glass and the circular clamp  jumped out  while it s bad sign  i still thought it s ok as long as i could put them together  well  the glass was not clear  as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper  i never saw any filter or lens in that shape before    before to ship it back  i did try to put three pieces togather  so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box   guess what  the circular clamp was about mm longer and two ends could nt meet    i could nt image any scenario under which this could happen  since it was from amazon  not from some unknowns of ebay  actually  any ebayer will have to worry about the feedback   i was really shocked that amazon shipped that garbage to its customer  hope this is just a random incident and amazon does have a very easy return practice  otherwise  i would not buy anything from amazon
__label__1 i am not a horror movie fan  in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me  but this one indeed made me literally crap myself  i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc  years ago  and luckily the movie was just starting  so i got to see it from beginning to end  this movie is basically about a man named frank zito  joe spinell  who s a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women  because he feels he s getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute  after her death frank feels alone  but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years  frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city  in which he keeps several mannequins  he uses these mannequins by putting his victim s bloody scalps  on it s heads  when he spots a woman named anna  caroline munro   a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her  but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her  but kind of a romantic interest  he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts  but will he change his mind about her  and make her become another one of his victims  some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gutwrenching  especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station  and she hides in a bathroom stall  i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time  the effects were realistic  nice job tom savini    they do nt come close to todays  even though the movie was released in  joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real  and not only that  but he physically looked the part too  the scenes where he s in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie  i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there  because we get to see the results of how an alone  mistreated child might turn out  this is nt one of those lame zombie movies  it s the real deal  if you like horror  and a lot of gore  and you have nt seen this then i recommend you watching this
__label__1 i use microsoft streets and trips  in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime i m traveling to a destination where i m not absolutely certain how to get there  in general  i m pleased with it s performance  it has saved me from wrong turns many times  however  the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions  gps tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant  off route    back on route  messages as you navigate twists and turns  i suspect  in that case  the map data is just not that accurate
__label__0 the description of this product on the amazon site does not match what i received  like another reviewer mentioned  the product was actually shipped from the uk so it took longer  and several features listed as being in the product are not there  specifically  exporting  saving of loops is not allowed  and there is no library of  loops included either  it seems to me to be basically like a demo version  also  even though it was advertised as being new in the box  all i got was what looks like a  used  cd with no manual or cd key  so much for upgrading later  i am returning it  the sku should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
__label__0 my boyfriend and i went to this movie we both hated it  it was really pathetic  perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it  yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people  it is pathetic  i would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with  low self esteem  do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this  perhaps it is funny  but just do not be around one of these people in reality  it is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are  not all men are virgins like this man  but some might as well be because they have no clue about women  they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand
__label__0 much worse than previous mcafee editions  i dropped norton on some older desktops due to its lack of support for w i then went to the free edition of avg antivirus  which was ok but slowed things down  thinking  you get what you pay for  i sprung for mcafee which has been ok in the past  the edition i purchased has  licenses  i installed one of these on my wife s xp laptop as well as one of my desktops  luckily  she s still talking to me   the  mcafee suite makes avg look like a free ferrari  absolutely terrible performance  coupled with a mediocre interface  perhaps the only poorerperforming way to assure you ll never get a virus  spam  etc would be to hit your motherboard with a hammer  this will slow down your computer  even worse  unpredictably   if you have lots of email in outlook or outlook express expect to open your mail box  then have a long break before you can do a thing  as it rechecks everything for spam   there s a partial workaround for this  but users should nt have to search for workarounds  every web action now has noticeable latency   as well as slower applications when mcafee is grinding away in the background  if you liked your current antispam  kiss it goodbye   mcafee may not let you keep it  mcafee  like norton  is also difficult to remove from your system  what prompted this review  today it appears the update process rebooted my computer without requiring a  yes  from me  as for alternatives  i was nt able to get kaspersky antivirus to run on an older machine   somewhare a remnant of norton persisted  possibly a document tagged symantec etc left over from a day of working with them ages ago   however  i did get it running on a laptop and its better than nortonmcafeeand even avg in my opinion  so  consider kaspersky or another vendor  if that does nt work try avg  it will be interesting to see how mcafee responds   they ve really shot themselves in the foot with this release
__label__1 this is the best  la traviata   i was so moved that i had to take a break  it really touched me deeply
__label__0 a friend who knows my taste in music recommended vnv nation to me  so i got matter  form based on the reviews  in one sense i like it  the production is excellent and i find every track to be creative and unique  but i hate the vocals and so i ca nt bear to listen to the cd  this dude has the worst voice in music history
__label__1 this volume contains  middle length sutras which are mainly sermons to monks on buddhist practices  having compared the pali original with the translation of about  sutras i would give it a high fidelity rating  the appendix contains extensive notes which discuss the text from the viewpoint of the theravada commentaries  a must read for those who want to learn or study using original source material and do not read pali  the introduction contains valuable material on buddhism by a bhikkhu long  goneforth
__label__0 i bought a pack of  and used twice daily in the shower to try and clear my oily skin problems  this product left my skin dry and sometimes peeling  did not work for me  but it might work for you
__label__1 i am a professional photographer  and i have owned this camera for nearly two years  i also have a d for backup  the batteries go forever  it is very quick to respond  the images are beautiful  and it has the typical nikon durability and reliability  if you are already a nikon user  the controls will fall easily to hand  that having been said  the computer software with this camera is a joke  for the best image quality shoot raw files  color balance with a grey card  and render the images with software like capture one le  the uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars  come on  nikon  be real    shortly after i got my first d  i shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog  i got an ugly feeling in my gut when i was told that the designer had taken a shot that was    figure  cropped to the head and shoulders  and enlarged the image for the cover of the  x  in catalog  by the time i found out  it was already at the printer  as it turned out  i was pleasantly surprised  the cover shot looked great  after that incident  i have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results  this camera is better than  mm in every way except response to the shutter button  in resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera  it is imperative to shoot raw and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera  i ca nt wait to try the d
__label__1 although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys  the pbbb is where the hippy generation   this is a couple years presan francisco  and before the stones and beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record   learned to just play  their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time  and is the single greatest influence on what became the san francisco sound of the late  s and early  s   really long and experimental jamming   so this is in fact the  quot  roots of the roots of the rootsquot  of todays jam bands and guitarheavy blues bands  mixedrace bands  and  for all practical purposes  the whitebluesman in todays  world
__label__0 the content is excellent  the digital format is largely useless  i bought the digital th edition to supplement my paper th edition  but  the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca nt print selected pages to stick in a folder  read on the train  or scribble notes on  i ca nt even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic  notes  file  the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one
__label__1 i got my movie sooner than expected  it was in a new like condition  very nice and thanks
__label__1 i thought i was fairly familiar with the sanibel island area  but this book definitely gave me new insight  the author definitely  knows her stuff  and has written a very informative and interesting guide  anyone visiting sanibel  especially firsttimers  should definitely get a copy before they go
__label__1 the best sports bar around  great taste  organic  contains plenty of antioxidants  and contains a good amount of protein  the only down side is the high amount of carbs  especially the sugars  but i still give it five stars
__label__1 very handy and portable  fits my neck good and i can even walk around with it on and not worry about it falling off or moving
__label__1 i also used this book in my graduate program  this book provides an excellent overview student development theory  it is an excellent introductory text  i had the added benefit of using this text in a course taught by one of the authors
__label__1 if you do nt need outlook but do need powerpoint  this is a great value  before  you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price  full retail  now   office  standard even on ebay is still going for  plus  this does not offer anything much beyond office  but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn  also  do nt worry about file formats  you can reset the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office
__label__0 i think the shaver works well  but the plastic is thin and cheap  the biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor  cleaning brush and charger  i think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case
__label__1 i was able to scout out the different case options for my sony dscn after much review  i asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the lcsnb  it holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery  so far  so good
__label__1 good product but  it s kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required
__label__1 this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot  watch your ears and fingertips
__label__0 i have to admit  i expected a lot more from mr setzer  the first track was ok  then it proceeded to go down hill from there  not much rockabilly happening  then it all comes clear with  really rockabilly  when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fansworld wide  he even gives us aussies a serv  even though i do nt think he has ever set foot here  if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing  jazz  rock or whatever  then go ahead  but why slag your old fans   it s the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first
__label__1 had i read these reviews before buying this  i probably would nt have purchased it  but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked  i did nt ask if there was a certain model that he recommended  so i assumed i d have to pay from   for a sonicare  when i saw this one for  at target  i figured i did nt have much to lose  i ve had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist could nt get  it turns off automatically after  minutes  so i know that i m brushing my teeth longer  one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it s goingyou ll splatter toothpaste all over yourself  d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush   the only negative is that it goes thru  aa batteries about once a month  but the directions said that it lasts about  brushes per battery change and that s about right  i ve started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems
__label__1 this was the first punkorama cd i listened to  and boy i was not dissapointed  most of the songs on this cd are the type of punk i would listen to  quite fast and energetic  the best song on the cd has to be either nofx  bath of least resistance  nofx being the greatest punk band of all time  of course   or beatsteaks  let me in  i heard the beatsteaks for the first time on this cd and there absolutely bloody excellent  obviously  the cd is made complete with songs from the descendents  pulley  pennywise  dropkick murphys  the only let down on this cd is noise conspiracy  there song on this cd  well plainly sucks i m sorry to say  but overall this cd is one hell of a good listen if your into punk  that s all  oh yeah  buy it  by
__label__0 the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time  an number or not the same  an it  s not the same battery  do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
__label__1 other than that this is a proper introduction to the heavster
__label__1 at first i didnt like this game because of the graphics but once i learned how to play i really thought it was fun one time i was so interested that i woke up at am and played the whole game to pm if you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do not like horses you might still like it but i dont know because i am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game  feed and groom your horse every day  keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships they will giveyou tasks to do for instance  breed a horse    you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves if you buy this item i hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you  libb
__label__0 this is not a good study guide for an employment law class  too basic and general  this may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring  firing etc  but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
__label__1 so far  i really love this camera  it s very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a very basic mode or normal mode  what attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality  it has a large viewing area which is nice and it s very clear  i recommend this camera
__label__0 many of the columns were interesting    painting a picture of a vast rightring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse  but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete  without any interest either as themselves or as a theme  does anyone care about texas state politics in   or phil gramm s problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate  someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete  except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book  just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read
__label__0 other reviews have homed in on the frequent nitpicking and general vindictiveness of this book  i agree with these criticisms  but i m not going to revisit them here  the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute  which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari s party line  as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full  unconditional scholarly access to miss rand s papers  any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice  nor should they be
__label__1 i give the db pro  stars  but i am totally disappointed in amazoncom and the gamecreaters  heres why the first thing i noticed is my box is different than that shown here  http    darkbasicprothegamecreatorscom i didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link above i cant find the over  demo s over  tutorials over  textures over  sound effects  d models that is stated here  http    darkbasicthegamecreatorscom  i applied the  upgrade patch and now my program wont start  it says its missing msvcrdll file  the original version was  i cant believe the darkbasiccom is advertising this product  yet amazoncom is shipping some ancient version  hopefully i will be able to resolve this issue
__label__0 not what i expected when renting this movie  as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent  futhermore  i do nt understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world  everyone knows what lovelace has donethere are numerous accounts  yet she goes with him anyway  blah  the acting was ok  the costumes were excellent  i love period movies  but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged  and as another put it  i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket  i read a lot of historical fiction  classic novels and love period movies  but there was no liking this one  it just couldnt be done
__label__1 i love this program    it is so great to see the dimensions  wall colors  decorating ideas at my fingertips
__label__0 the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the s  it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series  it was a travesty to see optimus prime  the greatest of the transformers  fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor  rodimus prime  who proved incapable of leadership  galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic  why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle  as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie  they were forgettable  it amuses me that  fans  are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago  the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did  as a fan  i was insulted  perhaps these other  fans  have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage
__label__0 this software is  one time use   if you have a notebook and laptop  you wo nt be able to install for both  it sucks
__label__1 it is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer  it does its job pretty nicely  the dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world  a little big for travelling  but compromises with its folding handle and light weight  the disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in  voltage  it is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment
__label__0 i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable  the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good  seconds  during this time the camera s view finder goes black and you cannot use it  because the camera is so slow  we have missed many important pictures of our children  consequently  we found that for any important family events  this is not the camera we use  i own nikon mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product  if it is your life your recording  i recommend that you buy a different camera
__label__0 unfortunately ttd went off the deep end on this album  consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album  quot  symphony or damnquot  and the superb follow up  quot  vibratorquot   if you loved the first album  give this one a miss and get the two i just mentioned  come on ttd hurry up and release a new album
__label__0 the product does not work as it is shown on tv  there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy  the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust
__label__0 all the information  and more  you can find in the manual included in your nikon d camera box  do not waste yor money and time
__label__1 this film is a mustsee for any dancer  the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative  many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be  for ballet dancers  there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov  scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets  liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length  i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a mustown selection for any dancer
__label__0 it s not an item to write home about  final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular  the wifi works some days  mostly not  if i d known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser
__label__1 i installed norton antivirus  immediately after installing windows vista  office  and other software on a new computer  installation ran smoothly  liveupdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch  norton antivirus  not only detects viruses  it detects spyware and rootkits as well  it has an inbound firewall  and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities  it does not protect against phishing  identity theft  or spam  nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection  when installed on windows vista  norton antivirus takes over for windows defender and the windows firewall  i did not expect the latter  symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall  norton antivirus integrates well with windows security center  norton antivirus  is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions  norton antivirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products  the only other product that i would use myself is mcafee virusscan  but i have always felt that norton antivirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system  for those of you installing norton antivirus  as an upgrade  i would highly recommend that you first remove any existing norton security products using add  remove programs in the control panel  then  download and run the norton removal tool from the symantec site to make sure that it s all gone  to see a comparison chart of the norton  windows protection products as of this posting date  browse to symantec s site  click on  norton  products  under home products  click on related link  view all products  and then click  compare  next to pc security
__label__0 this frame looks great until you turn it on  the picture quality is less than stellar  but that is nt what annoyed me about this frame  when you buy this frame do nt expect to view your photos at the  ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program  what does that mean you ask  that means that your photos wo nt fill the entire screen in the  mode  you will have  black bars on either side of your images  this will not take advantage of the entire frame  if you switch to the  mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame  making peoples faces distorted  i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation  see below  the build quality of the frame is pretty good  if mustek would fix the  problem and get a better quality screen  this would be a nice little frame  a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the  ratio  but i figured it out   stretches the image  making it look distorted  these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal  i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse  you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image  some of your images might be better served one at a time  start with an image that is x in your image editing program   go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to   or  pixels  this will make the image look distorted  that is ok   then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to   or  pixels  the image is ready to save  you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed   copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame
__label__0 this is an item that i purchased from amazoncom that i am not satisfied with  i cannot install the game on my computer to play it  i had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play  she believes that it could be a damaged disk  and that i should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy  i hope you can help me with this  thank you for your support  sharon moseley
__label__0 just terrible software  often does not work  if that would be the only thing it would be enough  but it is worse than that  bogs down your computer big time  makes it run super slow  horrible  whoever has written good reviews must be shills for norton  avoid  repeat  avoid
__label__1 this is the  copy version of norton av   one cd will create three copies  i purchased it to save money as it was less than  per copy  i bought it to replace nav  on the same three computers which had expired  installed easily on two machines  just the uninstall of  and the install of  the first machine was more difficult  there is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a  clean boot  per norton web site instructions  i kept running into the  blue screen of death  on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the norton av  each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more  but all of the help came from the symantec  norton  website  it is now working fine  added  my personal preference is to not use software firewalls  i use a router with nat as a hardware firewall   it only blocks unauthorized incoming malware  software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off  they are intended to look for malware by behavior  antivirus programs look for malware by signature  the only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware s existence  if one has an antivirus program it will eventually  within a few days  find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about   assuming they have nt given up yet with too many cries for wolf   so the only software firewall i have  microsoft os firewall  is turned off and thus i have nt had the same problem as others report  as a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites  so far no problems with malware
__label__0 this is a simple drawing program  much like paint  do nt be mislead by the colored picture on the cover  it only does black and white  and it has no help in drawing manga figures  and it is a strippeddown program  at that  the documentation is for the full program  so you ca nt do much of what you read in the manual and help files  save your money  this program is nt worth buying
__label__1 with freddie backed by herbie  ron carter  and tony williamsthis is highflight crisp and inspiring musicworthy of repeated listenings  listen and enjoywilliams is over the top  very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventivenessi ve always noticed how carter and williams really spur hancock on as you will notice in this sethancock  one the the truly great pianist of postbop era  sounds like he is his having the time of his lifeit does nt get much better than this
__label__0 i am soooo glad that i checked this out of the library and did nt pay for this garbage  i really should of listened to the reviews on this book before i wasted a day reading it  actually  about halfway through i skimmed  the first couple chapters were nt bad  but the rest was just awful  gracie  her exhusband  her friendsthey are the most pathetic  shallow bunch of fakes i ve ever read about  what s even worse is that s the authors real life  maybe not the divorce part  but the rest of it   in the end  all i have to say is do nt waste your time   i should of listened to the others  but i did nt  and now i regret that i wasted so much time when i could of been reading something worth while
__label__1 my first viewing of this film was a great disappointment  i expected another jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy film  with chevalier substituting for eddy  and i emphatically did not like the film  then i viewed the film a second time  this time with the playbyplay voiceover analysis by miles kreuger  which comes as a extra bonus on this dvd  suddenly i was seeing the film in a completely different light  and absolutely loving this film  this dvd is an absolute gem  and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by miles kreuger  not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early s  it is as if a film critic from the s had come back to life  as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming  because he s talked to those who were   kreuger s commentary alone is worth the price of this dvd  after seeing this film for the first time  you must go back and see it again through miles kreuger s eyes
__label__1 this book is a celebration of color and the watercolor medium  turning the pages is like watching a fabulous fireworks display  each page reveals another explosion of beautiful color painting  like fireworks  some paintings go off with a huge bang  and others are more muted  but each painting has something to say   there are no  quot  duds  quot  helpful comments by the artists give insight as to how and why each painting was done  if you re an artist looking for inspiration  this book can really give you a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to your paints  even if you re not an artist  you ll enjoy the gorgeous colors and wide  wild variety of subjects and techniques  an astonishing book and well worth the price
__label__0 there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd  i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah  but the rest of the cd left me cold  i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them  it would have been better  i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy
__label__1 we got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it  her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there is nt as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film  we were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them  we were also aware of the battery problem  so she got rechargeable batteries  awesome little camcorder  especially for the price
__label__0 i thought this would be a good product for my computer  i did nt know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download  during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove  uninstall  delete  all of your known antivirus  spyware  and firewalls from your computer prior to install  this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message  i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download  i purchased the software on aug  and called customer support  they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue  they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans  microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support  those that know the basics and those that know more  they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the  teir ii  agents  i chose pm  i received several calls over the next two weeks  all of them were outside of the specified time  i missed several of them because i have a career and a life  when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue  here it was  two weeks after i purchased the software  i still did not have what i needed  i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software  i called in several times druing the ordeal and the  teir i  agents just told me that i have to wait for the call   they ll get to it when they get to it   i was very upset with the customer support  i have no idea how the product is  but the customer support is just horrible  go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the  post your own thoughts  page through member accounts  you ll see that i m not alone in this issue  i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare  i did not have one problem with these installs  please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system  seperate from onecare   this costs an additional  ontop of the cost for onecare
__label__1 bought the massager  overall ok but it is heavy to use with one hand  after sometime it gets to you  it has a good vibration capability better than the others i had  could have a better handle and a longer cord  how about making them   v then i can travel with it
__label__0 i was very disappointed with this product  not only did it come in a foreign  chinese  box  it does nt work well at all  the  powder  that was included actually made it worse  if i were you  i would keep searching
__label__0 there are way to many lesbians still killing themselves because of the stresses of being a lesbian  it s not even mildly acceptable that there are still more suicide as an option  self victimization films that are being praised and sold to us

__label__1 dave barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from the miami herald  there is a huge margin in difference of quality in boogers are my beat than in his initial non fiction books such as dave barry s bad habits  boogers are my beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you do nt want to put down until the back cover  dave barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you ca nt use the towels hanging in the bathroom  the salt lake city olympics  babies on airlines  north dakota  bear in the big blue house and cell phones to name just a few  his article written the day after september  and one written a year after  about the philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career  thankfully he did nt because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his carl hiaasen style fiction novel tricky business  big trouble is nt bad either  check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well
__label__1 this album sends mixed messages to the listener  some tunes are overally happy  some quite depressing  i can only explain it in parts  radio song  the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking  a guest vocal from krsone makes it quite a lively tune  puts you in the mood for a more greenstyle album  losing my religion  huh  what s this  the album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled stipe spills problems out to the listener  the tortured riff holds out until the end  telling the listener this is nt quite like green or document  low  the depression lingers on  low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low  my favorite on the album  i think it s delicate and sad  my  downer tune  near wild heaven  another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst  deals with the apprehension of love  endgame  a curious tune  ca nt be interpreted either happy or sad  for it is instrumental  it could go either way  it s written in a major key  yet the melody sounds sobered  almost as if it s a requiem  shiny happy people  takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness  a low point on the album  yet i interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the antipastorial earlier tracks  belong  one track i do nt understand  yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album  half a world away  ah  so beautiful  essentially about enjoying life s finer moments at the expense of moments to come  truly happy  but still holds on to the softcore angst  texarkana  the lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it s about unfulfilled life goals  delves deeper into seeds of depression until  country feedback  the climax of saddness on the album  this song is excruciatingly sad  the melody  the lyrics  it kept me awake all night  one of the saddest songs i ve ever heard  me in honey  a powerful  joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out ok in the end  this album is highly recomended  rem are an incredible band
__label__1 this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man  at first  the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters  but the series remain true to the comics  the story lines they took from the comics were done very well  like episodes involving the silver surfer
__label__0 i returned this item  i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited
__label__0 stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes  and steven seagals  they are braindead movies with braindead screenplays  bad directors  bad everythings  this movie  like other viewers  said  drove me nuts  i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys  movies  otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration  amazoncom should also stay away from selling this crappy movie  god help us
__label__0 there s a reason oar flopped when it was released back in   it sucks  thirty eight years later  with skip spence safely in his grave  some now give this pitiful mess five stars  since you ca nt give more than five stars here  they re saying oar is on a level with masterpieces like sergeant pepper  dark side of the moon  led zeppelin   just between you and me  i think the government is still secretly drugging people  with all due respect to skip s venerable memory  oar is a painful aural experience  the first two tracks  little hands and cripple creek  are halfway good  and show some production values  but things quickly deteriorate from there  one gets the impression the rest of oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping  then put in the can after only one or two takes  lastly  the bass playing and drumming are just awful  yes  it s too bad that things ended up like they did for skip  and it s hard not to sympathize with him  he flew high only to crash hard  but let s keep a sense of perspective  his tragedy did not translate into good music  one extra star in his memory
__label__1 optimum nutrition s  whey protein is hands down the best i have tried  and i have tried a lot of different shake products in the past  years  i used to be committed to eas and labrada  but i found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to on whey protein  i mix it with water  and sometimes soy milk  it mixes easy  does nt taste gritty  and is pure protein  it goes down very easy and i have no trouble digesting it  plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan  plus  the price is reasonable
__label__0 the plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner  i was not in the same state when the package arrived so i was not able to open it for over a monthmy loss  i do nt know if it was not structurally sound  or if the box was just not handled properly  either way  i ve got a dud
__label__0 i cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews  i have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst  i am amazed that all the references to child murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers
__label__0 eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors  and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal  pointless  lurid and sadistic movie  dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating  maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult  with no conscience  morals  or regard for anyone but himself  bairstow plays the usual  quot  misunderstoodquot  teen who looks to the group for acceptance  the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence  enough is enough  if this is the way teens talk  then steer me clear  folks  there is no heart or soul in this movie  and no reason to rent or buy  no stars  cmon amazon  when you gonna give us the  stars options
__label__0 what a disjointed mess  talk about cashing in on fame  all he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book  i could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper  i was not that enamored with liar s poker and this book has done it for me with this author  it was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good
__label__0 this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete s other books  his writing buddies other books  and his golden touch craps siminar  this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control  which is the reason i bought this book  the book is rather a collection of stories  scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps  it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up  especially the captain  the authors ultimate craps hero  i could nt even finish this book  it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through  and left the reader with no knowledge gained  if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company
__label__0 once upon a time i was given a vanitypublished book to review  it was an illogical mess  full of breathtaking nonsequiturs  while reading  iron john   i could nt help thinking of it  the vanity book  however  was at least entertaining  john eldredge refers to  iron john  liberally in his book  wild at heart   and because i considered that a ringing endorsement  i purchased a copy  i ca nt tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it  the hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about  times  it s one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references  it s another to publish it  that people can slog through it and call it  profound  and  important  is baffling  what s even more mindboggling is that people claim that this book  spoke  to them  i think it s a case of  i d better say i understand it  or people will think i m not erudite   well  let me be erudite about it   iron john  is a big  steaming pile of new age crapola  do nt say i did nt warn you
__label__1 this talented woman can sing anything  i really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work  renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose  hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business  cassandra wilson  nancy wilson  regina belle  sarah vaughan  etc this cd of different musical styles reminds me of nina simone and cassandra wilson  two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special  i loved all the songs and the standouts here are  haunted heart    river    my one and only love    my cherie amour    cancao do amor   and beatles  in my life   and  hard times come again no more   i hope renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because i ll certainly always listen
__label__1 i bought this for my kids because i knew they would love these songs just as i did  forget them  i love it  there is nothing like the chipmunks and never will be again  the christmas song is worth the price alone  do nt think about it  just get it
__label__0 this mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification  x  is not sufficient
__label__1 the authors have done an excellent job in explaining testing methodologies for component based software  black box and white box testing methodologies have been explained particularly well  test automation and automation tools are also covered in great detail  the book also describes integration testing  regression testing and performance testing quite well  overall  this is one of the most comprehensive text books on this subject  i highly recommend it for both students and software professionals
__label__1 i ve been a skating fan for many years  and would recommend this book to everyone  i thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at brian boitano s career  from start to present  it s easy to read  so one can browse through it like a newspaper or magazinebut it s also stuffed full of valuable information about the technical aspects of skating and the  quot  behind the scenesquot  preparation activities for competitive skaters  the beautiful pictures lend itself to being picked up and enjoyed again and again  hats off to brian boitano  suzanne harper  and all the people who helped create this treasure for my coffee table
__label__1 i really think it s simon s best  this  and perhaps  in a very different style   paul simon   i m just listening to it again after several yearsthe melodies are intricate  the words are vivid and allusive  the range is astounding  graceland has a wonderful rockstyle going on  but i really think this is my favorite  i know a lot of nonsimon fans who love this one album  it s just fantastic
__label__0 i thought my jvc digital camera was handy  easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was  then one day at my daughter s ballet show  i turned it on  i made sure i charged it all night  and it would nt record  it kept saying that the lens cap was on  i am so frustrated and sad  i spent a good chunk of money on this item and do nt know what happened  still do nt have a way of recording my daughter s milestones  do nt buy it  if you have other options
__label__1 i love my new canon a large lcd makes taking pictures easy to frame  color and sharpness is good all around and needing only  aa batteries is great  i no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries  i can go into any drug store  only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card mb  for a few bucks more put in at least a gig  overall rating for a camera in this price range  above average
__label__0 great book  too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie  almost did nt finish reading it  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on  and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted  jeremy irons did a fine job  i look forward to starting the next book  but will skip the next movie
__label__0 jj  the name of the song you are looking for is  like you like an arsonist  by paris texas
__label__1 because the ideas and strategies really work  robert allen gives more concrete information  real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book  i used the ideas from robert allen to buy my first home  nothing down  years ago and the value of my home has escalated butthe return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite  heyif you do nt like robert allen  you can always read jane bryant quinn and lose money with her advice  i was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over  of his   k  money following quinn s  safe  advice  oryou can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized robert allen ideas
__label__0 plain and simple i m  years old and been dianosed with hbp since  years old  i m on three medication for hbp  i order this then i wait for it to come  i jjust happen to go to the doctor today  he takes my pressure and tells me its    when i arrive home one hour later  the device is waiting for me  i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is    sending the unit back
__label__0 after i installed this software  my windows xp system shut down with the dreaded  blue screen of death   i m still trying to return my system to its former useable state  beware
__label__1 this is a very extensive volume of expert advice on how to use windows xp and so far i have found it helpful  although a bit too technical that is not compatible with my xp
__label__0 first  know this  it is a trimmer not a shaver  with the included height attachment  your bound to have a little fuzz still left  without the attachment  you get closer results  but still very visible hair lines  i am quite disapointed with the product  because it runs on two aaa batteries  the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles  this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you  i would certainly not recommend this product  but might be necessary if you ll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild
__label__1 this is my second norelco wet shaver  so  yes  i like the product  here s my rundown  pluses   good shave  less razor burn  lot easier to insert packets  compared to my older model   easy to clean minuses   hard to get that  patch  under your nose  have to switch out an addon to get sideburns straight  battery  power seem to wane at times  packets are expensive i m a cheap sob  so here s my way of stretching out the life of the packets  wet your face first with hot water  rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion  do a first pass shave  rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face  shaver  keep a blade onhand to get the underthenose patch and your sideburns  allinall doner likes
__label__0 take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same  really  is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids  they deserve better  the key point of this movie is that lying is bad  good point  a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks  also good  unfortunately  the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible  even kids will have a hard time believing a man ca nt tell he s been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror   and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion  the entire thing falls flat  making films for children is a fine thing  they should nt be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children  however  quite honestly  i d rather have a kid watch something like  good will hunting  before this  do nt waste your children s time with this film  read them a book  a good book  instead
__label__0 i m in awe about what this program can do  but i ve yet to be able to use it to its fullest  it s not user friendly and i ve been designing photo brochures  and marketing literature and multimedia presentations for years with other design software  the coreltutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects  it takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program  and if you do nt use it daily  it s easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons  i was hoping the  student  teacher  edition would be more instructive  but it s not  i m currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a handson approach
__label__1 i have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down  as other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base  it makes dry shaving extremely smooth  as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess  you can use this with any type of electric  not just remingtons  and it s very easy to clean out  just tap it out and  or blow and  or brush  highly recommende
__label__1 i was bought for my month daughtor  this is her favorite litte touch book because lulu is very friendly friend  this is worthy of money  we love it
__label__1 i saw this movie on tv years ago and loved it  i thought the storyline was terrific  there s plenty of action  family situations  love interest  but  mostly  this movie engages you   it forces you to care about the characters  it s a great movie  three words  keep tissues handy
__label__0 this book was so simplistic  i was quite disappointed  you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all  a worthy goal  but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit  he really held back from delving into any dark territory  his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit  he always managed to put a happy  positive spin on everything  which is nice  but life is nt that simple
__label__1 though the lenses for my nikon d were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense  i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass  this size  mm  was what was specified for my d and it fits perfectly  as it should  i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller  if you are new to digital slr s like i was then get this filter to protect your lens  and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens
__label__1 this book has some of the most unique ideas for spending quality time with your mate  it has all the dates organized into categories based on how much time you have  how much money you want to spend  etc then at the end of each date there are questions and focus excerises to bridge a communication gap
__label__0 man  i hate this  i cannot take this any more  watch the original and that is it  the original needs no sequel at all  every sequel to the original sucks
__label__1 love my new jvc everio  the original model just used compact flash cards  but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year s worth of video on it  tape is definitely dead  and dvd camcorder s  mintues a disc does nt hold a candle to the everio  the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic  but all the other video editing software programs did nt recognize the everio video files  mod files which contain mpeg video and dolby stereo audio   i did finally find adobe premiere elements  which supports this new file type natively  it has made editing a breeze
__label__1 i find ms s expression web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from frontpage  frontpage  was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers  but the code view really was nt much better than notepad  not that i have a problem with notepad     i highly recommend it for the professional web designer
__label__1 i love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it  the product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at  the s is is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags  this bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries  chargers and extra media cards  there is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot  the correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens  given that limitation  this is a great bag  the bag is very well made and holds my canon powershot s is very securely  i lay the camera on it s back and that means that even if i accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly  the material is great and the waist belt is very practical  the strap is well padded and after a day of use i believe it is one of the most comfortable straps i have used  buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it
__label__1 sandra  hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program  check your printer drivers and spooler  i m as close to a computer guru as you d want having played with computers in general and pc s in particular since the heady early days of sinclair  kildall  and adam osborne  installed hallmark card studio on my beloved s machine several years back  was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner  my lady took to it immediately  and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user  only wish could import export data to other address books  and would nt it be great to have a palm conduit      i digress     every new version just gets better to the point  has close to two gigs of cards and imagery  in short  sandra hallmark card studio  is a keeper  now  approve of your using se  i recommend to my students  yes i teach computing  not to go beyond se and certainly not to connect anything from ms to the internet beyond se  little thing code name of palladium    there can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool try removing your printer under start    settings    printers  restart your computer with the printer on and reinstall  hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program  hb
__label__0 did not work at all  i used cheaper products that i bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them  since princereigns promised to be a miracle product  i bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it didt even reduce them  complete waste of money

__label__0 the other boleyn girl  and  the queen s fool  are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books  especially about this period  which especially fascinates me  they were gripping to the end  and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces  so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out  i buy it  hoping to have the same experience  and lately have been sorely disappointed   the virgin s lover  fell flat  and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged  must give it up  one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess  however it depends on the writer  anthony trollope  for instance  was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed  that may or may not be the case with gregory  i know  as a writer myself  that there are times when the work flows out  feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source  and times when it s harder  more mechanical  the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject  so to me  neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse  they feel forced  constructed  i m going back to trollope
__label__0 i had high expectations for this book  but i was disappointed  it concentrated too much on digital systems  rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment  i lost interested in the last    of the book  and could nt wait to finish
__label__0 the  fakenews  tv movie had already be done  and done better  ten years ealier as  special bulletin   where the first movie took its subject  nuclear disarmament and terrorism  seriously  this cheesefest does nt respect the viewers  intelligence at all  they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera  not of it ties together in any coherent way and the  make love not war  ending reeks of juniorhighschool sophistry
__label__0 yo numixx sux i hate when people make cd s like this to make some money off of great artist like pac  this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan  they take great songs and make crappy beats  get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money
__label__0 before using colorvision spyder my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop  my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too  the colors were spot on  after using spyder express my monitor looks worse  my monitor appears dim  the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull  if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would nt have wasted my time  my hope was that it would make my monitor look better  not worse  i am not at all satisfied with this product would nt recommend buying it  instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online
__label__0 getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teethand they were all for buying it
__label__0 the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent  but the drawings are the work of a hack  often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored  the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight  the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book  an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both  only valuable as a kitschy curiosity
__label__1 my baby is  moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers  size   from monthold  it is soft and my baby never have  rush  with it  my whole family love this diapers
__label__1 my mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds  birds  ect  but all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noiseand the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street  this is the only sound we need  we bought it for our  month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up  she slep great from day one  now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual  bath  jammies  book  sleepy machine  and off to sleep she goes
__label__0 i have had to set up a few new installs of the vista business on some servers and i was disappointed with the overall performance  my biggest gripe is when i tried to remotely log in from another pc and i sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click  yes  to allow the process to run  how irritating  kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in does nt it   also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the remote connections authorization  so when i thought i was remotely logging in under the new admin account name vista would nt let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity  some hidden place it took me  minutes to find  i discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when i did the name change  yikes  for those who need to run vnc server on vista  be aware there are issues  installing and running that you will need to work around as well  it seems like microsft drastically changed the menus  overdid the default security features  and installed a new hood ornament  other than that i do nt see what the big deal is
__label__1 this is one of my personal favorites  i bought this cd when my daughter was  month old  we would listen to it during those  late night  feedings to create a peaceful environment  i m pretty sure it was a benefit for her  it was definitely a benefit for me
__label__0 i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b  c it claims to be better than proactiv  after using proactiv for a month  then trying this stuff  acnefree does nt compare to proactiv  granted  this is better than a bar of soap  but it s definately worth spending the extra  to get proactiv
__label__0 no need to say more  these fgs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they re quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit  and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink  there just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts
__label__0 i ordered the ergo lounger  when i arrived  i was shocked to find that i could barely lift the box that it came in  i wanted to move it to another room to unpack  this was supposed to be lightweight  aluminum  but the box clearly said  steel   i did not want one that would rust because i intended to carry it to the beach to use it  i actually called the manufacturer  they provided a toll free number  several times  never did they answer the phone  nor did they ever return any of my calls  so i could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not  the lounger itself seemed pretty nice  just too heavy and probably would rust soon
__label__0 i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to inch apertures  so i expected better  i ordered this for my daughter  it arrived defective  the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket  making collimation impossible  in celestron s defense  it likely happened in transit  amazon s return policy is not a hassle  and i m upgrading her to another telescope  i m sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope  only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily
__label__0 we received it with broken cover  it did nt work properly and stopped running every hour  we tried different ways to make it run  but nothing worked  we ve returned it  it s just waste of money  on the other hand the cowhumidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well  no complaints
__label__1 i purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason  my old  watt conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom  the circuit kept tripping   so i was actually looking for a dryer with less wattage  however  i did nt want to sacrifice power  as i hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulderlength hair  so far  i ve been pleased with this hair dryer  it does seem a bit louder than my previous model not obnoxiously so  just a higher  more concentrated fan noise  the dryer is extremely light and compact  it s actually smaller than my folding travel dryer  it is very basic  with a choice of high  low settings only  there is no heat  cool option   but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higherwattage dryer  overall  this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
__label__1 i thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results  it works better than some of the more expensive software  i have tried at least a halfdozen similar programs  but i keep returning to this bargainbin favorite  for the money  it is an excellent value
__label__0 i purchased this table from another vendor the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off  it also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support  the table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top  i promptly returned this table
__label__0 i had an old sonicare  rechargable  for about a year and a half  i dropped it and it stopped working   my fault   not willing to pay  for another rechargable one  i thought i would give the e a try  i then bought my first e in august for  it mysteriously stopped working around december of   i did nt drop it this time   i bought a second one  it also mysteriously stopped working in march of   again  i did nt drop it or harm the toothbrush in any way    dead toothbrushes in  months  i m not sure if i should buy another e or if i should give up on the sonicare brand completely

__label__0 i bought the  easy share camera and printer dock  money thrown away   the camera does nt take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk  also in my opinion  it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it  i threw it on the floor and smashed it  not kidding  when i first got it  i called kodak and they told my son  who is knowledgeable in this stuff  how to reset the printer  we reset it and it worked for awhile  then it would nt work any more and i did away with it  no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked

__label__1 this is a wonderful product  it smells great as well as works great  i was worried that it would be too drying on my skin  but it wasnt  it seemed to balance between where it was needed and where it was nt
__label__0 imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directingthen you would have battlefield earth  it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars  you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project  just awful  if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed
__label__0 i was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera  i had hoped the ultrawide photos  which was my main reason for going with this camera  also would be ultra sharp  but instead they tended to be soft  the camera has a lag time of about   th of a second  so it s more of a point  shoot and wait camera  the v may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints  but do nt expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras  in my opinion  the camera squeezes too much out of a jpeg photo by way of compression and shooting tif files just is nt practical  i demand better image quality from my cameras and  when zooming in  i like to see detail  i certainly do nt like everything going soft
__label__1 i have had several digital cameras and this tops them all     everything they say about it  is true  i love not even having to think about batteries  i did nt believe what people said about the battery life  and i was just happy i did nt need to think about batteries  but i just got married and my  year old daughter took more than  pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer i hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next  days on our honeymoon with another  pictures taken  no low battery light      i even going to buy my parents one  also  one more note i love how fast you can take pictures  no wait  seconds between shots  i had a kodak digital before only     years old and hated it  i hated the download procedure  it did nt put your pictures onto your hard drive  but in it s own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare  you d have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop  remember what you called it and then attach it your email  this is the main reason why i purchased this camera  i will never own anything else  especially a kodak
__label__1 really  this is only worth  stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy  this is  of course  funny stuff  really  it s the kind of music where you do nt want other people to know you re listening to it  but oh my is it fun  this one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwieinspired power metalalbum  soaring guitars  highpitched vocals  doublebass drumming  a lot of neoclassical stuff  essentially the sound of mozart  bach and beethoven  just way less complex  both on the keyboards and the guitars  and of course  trumpets and brass  oh  how i loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a keyboard  cheese  cheese  cheese all the way  if you ve heard any rhapsodymaterial before  a songbysong breakdown is pretty unnecessary as you ll know exactly what to expect  they really did benefit from the better production on their next album  not to mention their latest opus   but legendary tales does nt sound bad by any means  and the songwriting is solid and pretty diverse  it s just cheesy  real cheesy  and truth be told  since it s a metal album the guitars could use a little more  oomph  here and there  this is more happy metal than heavy metal  but then again  they re singing about mystical lands and holy creatures  so behemothlike heavy guitars would nt really fit  we do nt wanna scare our warrior of ice now  do we
__label__0 i purchased this camera for my yr old daughter as her first digital camera  it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that  months after purchase  the flash stopped working  the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo s indoors or in low light  i would not recommend this camera
__label__0 i guess it s cheap  but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight  so it s pretty hard to get anything more than a  pound estimate  which is fine if you re not obsessive  but most people care about that increment
__label__1 i had first bought the  here and now  hoping to hear the original recordings  but was slightly disappointed that on that cd the older songs were live performances only  if you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed  this is the cd for you
__label__0 gnr were a very overrated band  i found appetite for destruction very dull  this atleast has the band s  great songs in november rain  civil war  and live and let die  get this for  great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums   they are not metal
__label__1 i used the public beta of lightroom  it was amazing  i could nt wait for final release of it  i ordered it  helpful for photographers   nondestructive editing  high recommended
__label__1 it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes it gets shocks like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes it gets more interesting as the plot unravels great actors picked for such roles the perfect killing machines one insane in the brain and one out to save lives that should nt be lost in the first place the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says  i just want to eat  i do nt wanna hurt you  then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal  and his reporter female friend comes in and says  good meal  as a question that is  and he says without words  makes a happy sigh  that s hilarious  and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food priceless movie worth the watch again and again i m glad i saw this on tv when i was younger and i m glad i got this on dv

__label__0 i am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion  i am not religious and i strive to take a learner s stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that i present to my students  betsy and guilio maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics  books that i have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias  this particular work unfortunately is neither  their gesture was genuine and gracious  an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote  no deity need take offense  all were included in the pantheon of possibilities  it is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors  though written as an overview of many of the world religions  this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism  the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other  one point ought to be obvious  though  everything ca nt be true  the religions mentioned are like oil and water  they ca nt mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts  an appeal to their similarities does nt help  we would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form  it s the differences that are critical  that s true in all areas of life  especially the spiritual  if god exists  he s either personal or not personal  he ca nt be both  if god is merely a cosmic energy  why ask his blessing  he ca nt hear or respond  if he s a person  then he s someone  not everyone  this book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew

__label__0 there are  good songs on this disc  stinkfist and aenema  the rest are pure crap  half of the tracks are nt even songs  they re just a bunch of noise  no wonder tool wo nt put any of thier music on itunes or napster  they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your  for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap  if you gave this cd  stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely
__label__0 after watching spirited away i was excited to watch other movies by the same director  unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic  it s bad to hate  message  what the creators of princess mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive  disgusting things of the world  yes  hate can become overly consuming  just as any other emotion can overcome us  or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one s   just as loving that which is evil would nt be a good thing  but placed in its proper context at the proper time  at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems  and the people who claim that hate is allevil themselves hate the  haters   which i find comical  the movie also has strong pro feminist  anti man messages  i wanted to like this film but i do nt appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense
__label__1 i purchased this camera for my son  he is a doctoral student and needed to photograph items for his research  he was able to learn to use it quickly  the battery life is phenomenal
__label__0 con express  has lots of action in it  which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters  unfortunately  the action is nt enough  and in between stunt pieces and shootouts  the audience is tempted to doze off  city heat productions is nt really known for producing films of the highest quality  so usually i go easy on them  if this were a bigbudget company producing this  i d be inclined to pan it entirely  but i was nt expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for  the action is  for the most part  pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie  flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted  but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie  vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an overthetop bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals  the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege   con air  spy game  and speed  if you liked those  you probably wo nt mind this one too much  just go easy on it

__label__0 after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing  mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect  so maybe the motor was already fixed    my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender  the zr  is ok in low light  but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it is nt to your liking  you can also adjust the focus too  my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par  i ve made two practice dvd s  with firewire  no problem at all  with this camera and like what i see  for those of you that have bad motornoise  try your video software to edit the noise out  power director has that feature  i am happy with this product  but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder  a great camcorder for beginners

__label__0 if you are looking for a  feel good  book about baby boomer retirement  this book may have some value for you  but if you are looking for specific indepth howto  this book is nt the answer  each segmentwork  dreams  travelis short and does nt address many relevant issues  for example  regarding the work chapter  the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap  well  that is speculative with globalism  those jobs may be outsourced  most are low paying  many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining  yes  there may be walmart jobs but is this your retirement dream  the work chapter sounds a lot like most  do what you love  books  but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income  these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their s are not addressed  i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner
__label__0 read some reviews that say  my cousin lost  pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day   and ask yourself  would nt that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day   this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value  if you wo nt drink water and exercise unless you have  special  water imbued with mythical powers  than by all means  this is the product for you  but if you prefer to save your money  simply exercise  eat healthier  and drink regular tap water
__label__1 janet browne s farreaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the th century s most controversial biologist  geologist  the first volume of a twovolume set   voyaging   begins  as you would expect  with his youth in the english town of shrewsbury under his father s care  we meet his father  a doctor and businessman  his brother  intelligent but unfocused  and his late grandfather erasmus darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views  from his early days  browne depicts a darwin struggling to find himself  first as a medical student in edinburgh  then as a student of theology in cambridge  though we know better what darwin is to be  browne s portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options  but the story often returns to darwin s love of the outdoors and of biology  a theme which underpins all of his early feints and missteps at life  he is seen as a frequent hunter  and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles  despite this  and despite the benefit of hindsight  at times i felt some tension  finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for  we finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard the beagle  a vessel bound for south america on a surveying mission  i wo nt spoil the rest  other than to say that browne does an excellent job of building darwin  showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid  capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence  finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature  and yet even then  darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world  privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed victorian society  in tenor  it s clear that browne  a professor in the history of biology greatly respects her subject  but she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed  darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station  and held certain prejudices that the author does nt hesitate to point out  such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery  she also reveals what some may find darwin s less endearing traits such as his antisocial tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science  when approaching the subject of marriage  darwin s priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who  he feared  might place demands on his time   she does seem to softpedal darwin s poor treatment of his companions on the beagle  many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage  and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized   for those curious  this theme is wellexplored in robert wright s  the moral animal   also  it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him  more my failing than the author s i think  as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on darwin s life  if you do decide to read it  it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes  although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book   certainly  the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution  and the legend of charles darwin  was born  i ve read few biographies better
__label__0 when i got this pedometer  i found that the instructions were nt clear  i never did get the thing to work  i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate  this one wasnt  the pedometer does nt cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost  it s just easier to buy a new one  however  i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store
__label__1 as a history major  undergrad  and former high school history teacher  i marvel at crichton s ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way  for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work  even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books  tgtr takes us to th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery  as well as life in general in th century london  so often history books give names  dates  connections  but leave one with the question   yes  but what was it like   crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text  some of it may be fanciful  but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text  at any rate  i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan  master criminal fan  or interested history student  the main character  whose name escapes me  alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel  very fascinating and rapidly moving
__label__1 the best buy in the marketplace  it easily fits into my suitcase for travelthe level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is
__label__1 i purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking  which i usually never do  usually i just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing   i came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product  of course  you could acomplish this with ms paint if you really wanted to  one of the main  and only  in my opinion  advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting  that alone makes it worth the  dollars you put into it  one downside is that this program  because of it s many tones  uses and requires quite a bit of space  when i uploaded it on my laptop  it slowed down significantly  so much so that now i load it when i want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again  xd overall it deserves about  stars
__label__0 i was disappointed getting this product because i ve read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron  i actually prefer the cheaper conair s ceremanic irons w  o the wet on  off feature over this one  it does nt clamp down well on my hair  i ve got thick frizzy hair   the results for me are nt that great  it straightens my hair a little but it s still frizzy  it s lightweight which is nice  i do nt care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair  i definitely prefer other models over this one
__label__0 overall  i was entirely disappointed with this camaera  the packaging and description were deceiving  there was no view finding screen  only a teeny  tiny window as in a regular camera  this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera  i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen  the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground  i would not recommend this to anyone
__label__0 my computer was running fine until i tried to upgrade  first it took almost  hours to install at the last  it found a error and was going to roll back  well it never did  it erased everything  it went to a dos prompt  called help line and it took  hours to just reload  when it was done  i had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive  not only that but he said i had to install again to register  it takes forever to install  took forever to get in touch with someone  they were in nova scotia  and i still do not have a working computer  i have to try and get a recover program to get my files back  i recommend staying away from this product for upgrades
__label__1 initially the sensation made me giggle  after a couple uses i got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly  my teeth feel cleaner  mouth fresher  and i m hopeful that i will no longer get the  floss  lecture from my dental team  now that s something to smile about
__label__0 i used version  and  and never experienced a problem  version latest version is terrible  crash and burn  do nt take their advice and reinstall your operating system  its their software and not the os  amazon and pinnacle  avid  continue to sell this product even though its terrible  i read it was rewritten for version  and they ca nt get it right  nonetheless  they still charge full price and for support calls  the upgrade should have been free  there are several good products now so pinnacle is nt your only choice  i changed to sony vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve  for super simple try ulead or one of the others

__label__1 this was perhaps the best of johannes steinhoff s books  since it does not deal with his own stellar yet tragic ww ii and post war career  the insights of the average person living in germany are of great importance to both social and military historians alike  steinhoff offered this collective testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise of a dictator  as johannes said in an interview   quot  it is always the civilians who suffer the most  yet are remembered the least  quot

__label__0 like the reviewer below  my dryer also stopped working within a short period  it was never dropped or misused   after about a month  it simply refused to turn on when plugged in  now  there is a decent warranty for the product  however  with the money you spend on shipping and the  they request for handling  return shipping  buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal  i do nt know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons  but since we both found our way to amazon with this review  i would nt recommend the product to other buyers

__label__0 paul ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do  but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works  he just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world  this book starts with the bold statement that  he had understood the population explosion for quite some time   nevertheless  the whole book proves that it s not the case  all his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable shortterm trend  his assumptions therefore include the  intelligent  assumption that there wo nt ever be any technological progress in the future  the climate will evolve in the worst possible way  and so forth  it s not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the us in the s  and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense  he repeated the same prediction for the s  why does he  and people like him  continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history  it s because of their religion  maybe they do nt call it a  religion   but it is a religion nevertheless  jehovah s witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day  because it did not occur in  and other years for which it was predicted  they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays  malthus had done very similar errors as ehrlich  but you may think that in the th century  people could know more than malthus knew many years ago  but ehrlich does not know more  in some sense  even karl marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions  marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such  and it would be globally replaced by communism   this is what i call a truly catastrophic prediction   marx was wrong  of course  because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to selfregulate and accomodate to new conditions  ehrlich is repeating all errors of marx and many other errors  too  but other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day ca nt learn from jehovah s witnesses mistakes  of course that paul ehrlich s reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions   bjorn lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions  namely these speculative questions about the longterm food problems  rationally   ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food  he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more  he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children  and so forth  he just does not understand the  invisible hand  of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions  his reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past  but it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future  his goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart  the similarity between ehrlich s predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence  find the book  boiling point  by ross gelbspan at this website  one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us  among the  mostly positive reviews of the book  you will also find a star review by paul ehrlich of stanford himself  the global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of paul ehrlich  it is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things  the universe and human stupidity  and i am not sure about the universe
__label__0 this is the dumbest  most predictable  horrible waste of time i ve ever ever seen  this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasnt  it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that s supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe  drink  and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us  after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash  my only hope is that our european friends did nt seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident

__label__1 wow    i bought this set a couple of months ago and i ve been watching each episode little by little  and enjoying each one of them a lot    it s interesting to watch captain scarlet again  thirtysomething years after the last time i watched it back in the late s  when i was  or  years old   i was  and still am  a huge fan of the  thunderbirds  and became quite delighted when this new series from gerry anderson first appeared on tv back in the s  the quality of captain scarlet s special effects obviously got better since the thunderbirds  and it really makes a huge difference  as far as realism is concerned  to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned  so much so  that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes  the production still looks fabulous after all these years  the design of vehicles  machines  personal equipment  weapons  buildings  etc is quite enjoyable  interesting and sometimes even surprising  the  angels   both airplanes and pilots  still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary    perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age  for they look quite dated indeed  however  now it seems a bit funny to see  chrysler and ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series  thirtysomething years later  most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow  almost stupid  but one has to remember that this series was meant for children  so  once you remember this you ll be ready to have a great time watching captain scarlet and his fellow spectrum buddies fight the evil mysterons  led by the sinister looking captain black   just as you did when you were still a child  spectrum is green    enjoy it
__label__1 i discovered this software by accident  while window shopping  and i ended up buying it and taking it home  i was able to get it up and running pretty quickly  and was creating my own music right out of the box  of course it takes some time  but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time  add a mic to your computer  and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording  editing studio  make your own music and burn it to cd  sounic foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web  by providing an online community of acid musicmakers who review and comment on one anothers  work  you can also listen to music published by other users  even if you re just a musical legend in your own living room  this makes it easy and fun to become just that  sound forge also sells music loops on cd especially for acid  but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work  sound forge also provides weekly samples for free on their acid planet website

__label__1 i have purchased both the home  gardens interior and the punch interior software  home  gardens is much easier to use  you can really start without reading much of the manual  punch demands that you read the manual   pages   it is not intuative  but punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity  ie  punch has a library of trees  shrubs and flowers for your yard  home  gardens only have potted plants  nothing you can use to landscape  punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications  hg doesnt  you have to choose a set style of door or window and change optionsi also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my  house  on punch to make it more realisitic  i like both software programs  but punch has more options  but you have to do your homework first

__label__0 another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victimand we wonder why our community has so many problemsmaybe it s because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films   color purple    for colored girls   etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we  work together  that means blackmen and blackwomen
__label__1 if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the d or rebel xt  you will be happier with the mm fisheye  this mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the  factor  if you love the fish eye style and have that camera  you ll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip  i was disapointed with this lens for that reason  the sigma mm is great  a note to the reviewer below  sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones  this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy  it happens often enough with sigma gear  with this lens  its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want  bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out  decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy  i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge  sounds like you got a bad one

__label__0 i added these batteries to an order of a few other things  and did nt realize that they were going to ship this separately from circuit city  make sure if you pick this  that you are getting something else from cc  or else you will end up like me  with a huge box  you could fit  tom clancey novels in the box  shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries
__label__1 fast times at ridgemont high is a clever  insightful  and wicked film  it is not just another teen movie  though to the casual observer it might be  no  it is a time capsule into the socal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late  s and  s as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the us circa  sean penn  whom i m not a big fan of  as jeff spicoli is truly inspired  i find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes  what an awesome character  when he says   you dck   to ray walston s mr hand  another inspired and forever memorable character   you just wanna roll on the floor  jennifer jason leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality  phoebe cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly  mature  relationship anyone has  with a college boy  is fresh and believable  judge reinhold as leigh s older brother is inspired  mike damone is a sleaze and a great character  if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to   in fact  this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars  the script by a very young cameron crowe is brilliant  fast times came out at roughly the same time as the last american virgin and several years after rock and roll high school  neither of those other films is anywhere on par with fast times  at times  light and airy  fast times carries a serious  message  that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how  it is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film  the adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home  truly  teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents  while last american virgin approached some of the same topics that fast times does  it did it in a more sinister way  fast times does nt gloss over teen age problems  but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his  herself deals with them  yes  it s a comedy and yes it is funny  but it is not just a film for kids
__label__0 i bought this cd after having seen ken burns  special on pbs  the energy that came through on screen in the benny goodman segments does nt really come through in this cd  artie shaw said that benny goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability  that shows in this collection  afterall  where would jazz be if jazz musicians did nt take risks
__label__0 i was interested in dante s thoughts on hell  religion  and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing  what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy  this book is great for the first few chapters  but then it becomes a repetitive saga  synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno  go to next layer of hell  describe in  words or less the torture found there  make fun of some political opponents  catholic church officials  and so forth  prepare for further descent  in my opinion  this book resides somewhere between the st and nd layers of hell  canto three pretty much has it right   leave all hope  ye that enter
__label__1 i have been a fan for jaci velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages  i do not speak spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less  this album lived up to the velasquez name in my book  my family and i only really enjoy the traditional sounding christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions  jaci s album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my christmas traditions  overall i love this album and the only reason i did not give it a full five stars was that i am done with that chipmunk song  sorry everybody
__label__0 i got the impression that rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor  it was superficial  with such helpful hints as  quot  people come in all sizes and shapes   quot  and  quot  people with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly  quot  i did nt need to read her book to figure those out  her logic is also flawed  she states that   quot  doctors touch patients  not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients  quot  did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them  not because of any power status  using the book to promote her feminist beliefs  numerous typographical errors  and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer
__label__0 this effort shows it s age  in addition  there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudoscientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele  i suppose it s possible for it to be taken as tongueincheek by those at the postgraduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology  however  i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing
__label__1 this fantastic reimagining of the avengers is best consumed in this form  yes there are too many pop culture references  yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic  thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about  this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory  ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good  the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november  and is pretty amazing as well  this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer  is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers  no inline skates  teen angst  or first love in this one  millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd  these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand  my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold  it sucked and the new series isnt much better  thankfully it has only one issue to go  hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse  removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement  the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin  yes it s  just  a super hero comic but its one of the best  so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out  and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover
__label__0 i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it  for a point and shoot it is bad  it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot  it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings  while i enjoy some of them  most of the time my pictures turn out grainy  in low light   whitewashed  with flash  or blurry  of even slowly moving objects   i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things  but i rarely get a good picture when i need it  i never had these problems with my elph s this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well  and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on  if given the option i would not buy this camera again
__label__1 really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now  the tutorial is helping a great deal  i am positive that i will find all the right buttons
__label__1 rolling stone has long been the  gold standard  for rock journalism  any history of rock and roll that does nt have billy joel or bob seger is all right by me  i need to update my copy right away  great job  as usual  rolling stone
__label__1 this thing is amazing  my plasma is like a whole new tv  my   sony sxrd paired with a ps is the best looking picture i have ever seen  after using the stv this is a must have
__label__1 i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for  years now  i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift  it s a pretty good method  sometimes a bit difficult to work with  but you do learn some things  i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp  so make sure you have all the right equipment  and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who s taken guitar lessons
__label__0 not particularly musical  only  good track  blues for miles
__label__0 the monitor works really well  the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking  if you are looking for a good basic monitor  this is a great unit
__label__0 i love this turban  it enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head  it s lightweight and extremely absorbant  i have been using one for more than  years  i ll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair
__label__1 i purchased a nikon l from costco  weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz the lz is way better in all aspects than the nikon l  save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode  pros  takes great pictures  optical image stabilization  x zoom  and  great price  it is also made in japan  not china as the nikon l is  cons  fixed zoom while in movie mode  no onboard camera speakers
__label__0 do not buy this    it does not work  as seen on tv  we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it  would not cut a tomato  onion  carrot  apple only a cucumber  complete waste of money
__label__0 a great idea poorly executed  the construction is cheap  the screen is marginal at best  but worst of all  it refuses to recognize any of the  digital cameras i have on hand or a usb card reader  a piece of junk that i am now returnin
__label__1 the cover over the lense broke  small lcd screen  pictures are pritty good  battery life is pritty good  some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady  takes nice portaits  easy to use  has a veiwfinder
__label__1 i use it with my nikon d  and am very satisfied with it  i most often use it for long exposures  for taking picture that include myself  and for taking pictures of my month old daughter  who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold the camera  so i place it on the tripod  and take pictures of her
__label__0 the singing is terrible on  fly me to the moon   do nt take my word for it  listen to the free sample supplied by amazoncom  at  seconds into it  when she sings  all i worship and adore   she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes  even someone with no musical training can hear it  the rest of the pieces sound fine
__label__0 this product does not work if you have soft blonde hair  my hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing  it s comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well  but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair
__label__0 pictures do not come out very good  poor quality  i would not recommend it
__label__1 i m currently learning how to use this product  however  one of the first things i noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a service  now of course  this service was nt free and with only  employees  the last thing i wanted to do was expend  a month on a service  was nt that the point of getting quickbooks  so i could do it myself  now i can understand that tax codes  percentages  etc can vary from state to state  but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks  see  i m not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts  simple would have been fine with me  as for the rest of the program  it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after i figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business  i m disappointed that a business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
__label__1 well it s not quite as good as rising which is the best album ever but it s still amazing  man on the silver mountain     this track is a classic and is still played at every dio concert and ritchie blackmore still performed it at every rainbow concert until rainbow disbanded in  but anyway this may be ritchie blackmore s strongest riff ever  and dio s vocal performance is excellent  anyway it s a great fantasy song by dio and blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone  self portrait     excellent dark song by the band which fits dio s voice perfectly another classic  black sheep of the family     good song but not a rainbow song it s a cover and that s a shame because i would have loved to hear dio s brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen catch the rainbow     another classic from this album as dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers  blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every rainbow concert until dio left the band  snake charmer     another song that takes place in the middle ages which is rainbow s trademark  anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic  dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it s no suprise that blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one temple of the king     here is the best ballad of all time    ronnie s vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too  blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album  if you do nt like rock n roll     kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an elf track  sixteenth century greensleeves     great song  a real classic as dio puts togethor another great fantasy song  blackmore s riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding  still i m sad     well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too  the live version off on stage however with dio s vocals blow it away  i still wonder why there were nt any vocals on this  the band is ronnie james dio  vocals ritchie blackmore  guitar gary driscoll  drums mickey lee soule  keyboards  piano  mellatron craig guber  bass
__label__0 sorry  i hate to pile on  but i must agree with lit teacher on this one  the thinking was sloppy and contradictory  and the writing was wooden  stiff  irritating  i bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until i could get around to it  i pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes  boy was i disappointed  i thought maybe i was having a bad day  maybe my concentration was off  so i pulled out truman capote  smooth as silk  so it was nt my fault  it was rons  i finally decided to scan the book  and that revealed there was really nothing new here  nothing interesting  i wish i had not wasted the money  i must be more careful  but  as for this book  there is nothing i need to refer to later  so i m putting it in the trash  it is saturday evening  they will come on monday to take it and the other garbage away  roger
__label__1 one of the great metal albums of our time  from the drumming to the guitar alls that can be said is amazing
__label__0 this album made me realize that darn record company produces  for examle  two regular albums  two best albums  two tribute albums  and finally two mixture of everything under a soundslikenewbutactuallyanold albums from a musician  this is an example of the mixture of previously released  rereleased  at last  overreleased best tracks with a soundslikeregular album title  let me tell you one thing  jp is dead and gone since rob left the band  i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you ll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying
__label__0 first of all  this is not the worst movie ever made  nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars  the worst movie ever made was  autumn in new york   but that is a different review  no  this not a great movie  but it is very interesting  and for once  thank god  it does nt end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone  it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie  and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie  bleak  more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack  this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing  for molly ringwald  she did nt do anything of note again until  the stand  six years later  and for andrew mccarthy  well it could be argued that he still has nt starred in anything of note again  although he probably made some money from  weekend at bernies  i  ii   anyway  probably better to rent than buy  i am only buying it to complete my  s collection
__label__1 if you take lots of photos  rechargeable batteries are the way to go  carry the other charged batteries with you in case you need to swap them out
__label__0 i installed a perfectly legal upgrade of photoshop cs it worked fine for a handful of months  and then it quit  technical support was of no help  i had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine  i am so frustrated about this  i probably spent  hours with the data backup  moving data  reformatting  and reinstalling  if i were a small business  i would be out of business  all because this piece of crap program  which i purchased legally  decided to quit  totally unacceptable
__label__0 ugh i did not even try to finish the book  it is full of sexual content  not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature
__label__1 the monitor is relatively cheap  easy to use  and mostly accurate  the one gripe i have is that if i take my pulse  times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to  points  usually  this is not a problem  i tend to check it  times and average the  which is sufficient for my purposes
__label__1 my roomate from two years ago had a cd of doris  and i must admit  at first  i was a little skeptical  but soon i became stunned by her vocal prowess and the emotional heart juice that she brought to these classic songs  plus  you should see her in a football uniform  man can she catch the pigskin
__label__1 if you are familiar with the work of strobel  this book will continue to impress you  if you are not however  and would like to know where the author is coming from  i encourage you to read his previous works   the case for christ  and  the case for faith  so that you might better understand strobel  some people have condemned this book because strobel does nt present the evolutionary side well  i have a few quick observations to make  first of all  he s a journalist  he asks tough questions and  for the most part  gets good responses  second  everyone has an agenda  without exception  strobel  and those who he interviews  analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern darwinian scientific views  finally  it is clear from the outset that strobel wants to make a compelling case for id  this is not an unreasonable goal  the fact that he does nt interview evolutionists should nt bother anyone  based on his obvious objectives  if you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a pointcounter point series book  if you want to understand the current id debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator  this book is for you
__label__0 i bought this for my two sons  ages  and   to help them develop speed with their memory math skills  what a disappointment  even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game  each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off  good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed  i wish i d purchased a different product
__label__0 i ve had this straightener for about  months  i loved it at first but now it s a love  hate relationship  the  gold  plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use  the effect  my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff  to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates  i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair  something that is hard to do  this is the second store brand straightener i ve purchased with poor results  save your  and buy a professional model from a hairdresser  it s cheaper in the long run
__label__1 i have had a couple sets of these  and love them  this set is for a gift  i am so anxious to give it to her
__label__1 i am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the dragon software over the last eight to  years  i was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product  however  i now own version  and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product  if i were still practicing law  i would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice  because i did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable  i purchased a wireless microphone  by nady  which i have also reviewed  which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program  the program required less than onehalf hour of setup although i have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns  this dictation is much more accurate than my typing  and i have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well  my only regret is that i purchased the basic program  rather than an advanced program  now that i see how well the product works  i wish that i had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just english as i am fluent in spanish and have a growing acquaintance with french  incidentally  i dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send emails  as well as dictate letters  memoranda and outlines in microsoft word  it may be relevant to note that i am not using an underpowered computer system  i have an amd dual core system with  mb of ram  i am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional
__label__0 this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix  it turns them a light shade of grey  maybe  it is horrible  this to me renders it useless  it is for the most basic of users  there are no real manual functions to speak of  and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it  it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly  i would say do not buy  seller was great  product is poor
__label__0 temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts  conditions   locations in the book  and in about the rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about  gabby  including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place  how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life  book was not for me i dropped it at the rd chapter
__label__1 simple and great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user  i would say it is the beginner to intermediate user tool  i can really create fast movies very quickly  pros  easy to install easy to split  edit home videos compatible with ilink support for high definition hdv camcorders competitive price cons  user interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows  rendering is slow
__label__0 shaker is adequate for breaking down whey  but it leaks  i always have to wash my hands and the outside of the bottle after making anything with it
__label__1 its a good software  it works good and keep the computer safe from spam  virus  and some others malware  try it
__label__1 very good camera  this was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera  she picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit  directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger  takes some getting used to  zoom lense works great and takes good pictures  where the onoff button is so close to the shutter  you have to be careful that you do nt accidentally shut the camera off  she is very satisfied with it
__label__0 my rheumatologist recommended that i try a wax bath product for the osteoarthritis in my thumbs  the cartiledge in the left thumb is all but gone  with the right thumb being in better shape  the wax bath did not eliminate or ease the pain in either thumb  but did greatly improved the skin on both hands  i continue to use it just for the dry skin on my hands  and am pleased with the results  it s possible that this product would have worked better for me if i d used it earlier  before my thumbs got so bad  i plan to use the wax bath for the pain from inflammation in my feet  due to rheumatoid arthritis  i did have to turn down the heat due to a lifelong and extreme sensitivity to heat in my hands  and this is probably why the wax doe nt stay warm for longer than    minutes  even when wrapped in the plastic bags and then in a towel  the initial loading of wax has lasted a long time  so i do nt recommend purchasing more than  or  pounds of wax at a time
__label__1 i liked very much these series  you will enjoy every momets in this moives  it is deserve a place in my collection
__label__1 most people will say that episode one is their least favorite of all the star wars films  but john williams composure for this one is second only to the empire strikes back for the entire star wars trilogy  this extended version is a must have  it contains all the music from the movie  the entire fight scene at the end of the movie is included and its wonderful to listen to  i wish somoone would do the rest of the prequel trilogy like this cd  a must have
__label__0 after purchasing this product  i found there were several problems with scanning  i contacted nuance  who purchased scansoft  to ask for assistance from technical support  however  i then learned they want  for each incident when a request is made by email  not by phone  by email  after putting out a great deal of money for this product  i should not have to pay  for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product  save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product  i regret that amazon does not allow me to give this product    stars
__label__0 since our bathroom cabinet is short on space  i loved the idea of this hair dryer  unfortunately  the idea was more a fantasy than a reality  i only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cordkeeper button fell out  spring and all   and the retractible cord stopped retracting  since that was the only reason i bought this one over other models  i was sorely disappointed  also  this dryer is so loud that i had to wear earplugs  no kidding   while drying my hair so that i would nt damage my hearing  hands down the worst hair dryer on the market
__label__0 ok  the maps are good  but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car  it is very disracting and can easily cause an accident  does not work aroung lincoln tunnel area  also would not find my home street  and i have been there for  years  either the one i got was defected  or its not what other make it out to be  i had to return mine
__label__0 very limited photo touch up  when it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone  pretty much a total piece of crap
__label__0 there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film  but as a whole it just did nt quite work for me  vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character  fanda  a maddening yet adorable grandpa  ohsoyoungatheart  ohsomischievious and impish  but somehow ohsogoodhearted and harmless that you ca nt help loving him warts and all  in fact  that s one of the fatal flaws of this movie  the lack of any dark side to any of the characters  they re all basically harmless walt disney types  even the bumbling and selfabsorbed son  there are no real consequences to brodsky s actions other than stella  his wife  finally talking divorce but it s obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she ll come back to him  there is no center  no force or dynamic power in this film it s like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do nt want to hurt the feelings of your host  the ending also relies on another lazy device  the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice  supporter of fanda s when she sees that his attempt at selfreform is only making him miserable  this film might ve been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda s desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death  instead of focusing on how clever  audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is  which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse  narcissism  one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr brodsky  who is a towering figure among czech actors  that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him  a more accurate title for this movie  especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll  might be   the fantasy life of a poor old man
__label__1 but i m giving season four  stars  because there are nt any subtitles in this set  they also did nt have subtitles for season   but they did had subtitles for seasons    strange  huh  however  the quality of the dvds are fine and the episodes  of course  are wonderful to watch  at the end of this season the meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good  but he decides to stay with the bunkers a little longer  so he can get his masters degree  there are nt any special features or anything in this dvd set  but as long as the episodes are uncut  i m happy  if you re a fan of the show  this dvd set is a musthave
__label__0 they sent me a product that was nt legit and would nt take it back  horrible service  i do nt recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor  just a horrible waste of time  money
__label__1 nice cd cool beats songs like welcome to atlanta pick it u
__label__1 this is where afi began their sound change from their first  cd s  answer that  stay fashionable  very proud of ya   it is much more serious than the first   alot angrier  heavier  darker  and more screaming  yelling as well  some people say this is their best  i disagree  i prefer their  punkier  st  but i still enjoy this alot  it s all down to personal taste  it gets a    for me
__label__0 this upgrade is a disaster  first of all  in word  the view markups function is the default now  so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups  most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way   however  if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded   because you do nt know which version of word the recipient has  and you ca nt take the chance of them seeing all those comments   you have to go through the document again  view markups  reject the comments  accept changes  and resave  it s kind of difficult to explain  and frustrating too  people think that if they ca nt see it  then the recipient wo nt be able to see it either  this is a good explanation from a microsoft help forum  not displaying tracked changes is nt the same as not having tracked changes  even when using word   the changes were still in the documents  and anyone could see them just by turning on the display  all that has happened in  is that the display is automatic  the way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely   and to do that you must accept or reject all the changes  nothing you do with the view will be sufficient  if you need to retain a record of the changes  you ll have to maintain two sets of documents  one with the changes  which never leave your office  and another that has been  scrubbed  and can be sent out  still  it s a big problem and more unnecessary work than  s version  also  outlook s new default view is quite different than before  the panes are set differently  so you have to go to view  reading panes to change the positions  and then you have to ungroup items  the breaks in between the weeks are very annoyingmost people do nt like that  although i guess some people think it looks more organized   oh  microsoft  ca nt live with it  ca nt live without it  almost forgotthe buttons  icons are prettier in this version  and we all know that that makes a huge difference  yessss  pretty buttons  i can die happy now
__label__1 joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that s romantic enough for girls  funny enough for guys  with effective visual symbolism  and appropriate for the whole family  maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life  or something like that  but at any rate it s pleasant to watch  at times profound  at other times funny  the beginning rd is about joe  tom hanks  struggling with hypochondria and a lousy  really crummy job  primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical  oppressive  supervisor  dan hedaya    i ve been there myself  when i worked at pines mfg hh tooling and again at toro  where everyone was on dope   joe learns from his doctor  robert stack  of the untouchables  that he has a  brain cloud  and only a few months to live  the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that s ever happened to him  he takes a former coworker  meg ryan  to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time  the next day billionaire lloyd bridges  airplane  enters joe s life with a bizarre proposition  since he s dying anyway  why not literally jump into a volcano  for the billionaire s own financial motive  and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime  joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis  the client  and the billionaire s two daughters  both played by meg ryan  sleepless in seattle   which makes a total of  roles for her in this great movie  making it even more pleasant to watch
__label__0 i am leading a christian study group using popular films  i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth  unfortunately  the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the  church   i know that churches have problems and hurt people  but it is not as common as this author seems to assert  he seems very angry at the church  and for some reason  all of western culture  especially america   living in n  ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume  but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity  he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up  it is a good study of film  not movies  he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person  but not very useful in the context of the church  that s my take anyway  god bless
__label__0 i gave it two stars because it was great  when it worked  i got it sometime in january  and it lasted until about june  i take good care of my things  so i know its not me  it just suddenly stopped working  i m more than just a little miffed  i ve tried getting all different types of batteries  i ve tried letting it sit for a while  i ve taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff  its dead  i just threw it away
__label__0 myths are important  but they should not be labeled history   george washington was not a great guerilla leader  he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines just like the redcoats  washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops   ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear  disarming  of the soviet union  eisenhower and kennedy tried  but  lbj   nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty  the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals  reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe  but the  big nukes  that could end civilization were already being cut back  this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan  but some of the history cited is wrong
__label__1 the military courtroom drama   a few good men  is one of those films  that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it s own  but even with countless viewings it retains it s emotional power and speaks to us about issues  that have become more important than ever  in the film we meet lt daniel kaffee  tom cruise  a young successful  military lawyer  who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases  that supposably he s  never even seen the inside of a courtroom   he is assigned the cases of pfc louden downey  james marshall  and lance cpl harold dawson  wolgang bodison   they are accused of murder and a host of other charges  when at the guantanamo bay military base they performed a  code red   an illegal form of discipline within a military unit  on pvt william sandiago  which unintentionally resulted in his death  while the two accused marines admit they did the  code red   both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors  which includes base commander  col  nathan jessup  a brillaint jack nicholson  a powerful  highly decorated officer  who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command  with both time running out and a lack of legal evidence  kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case  even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy  through a brilliant script  based on the play by aaron sorkin   rob reiner s steady direction and the cast s dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as  code  honor  discipline   should a soldier always follow orders no matter what  whats  more important our ethics  principles  on which this country was founded  or our need for security  is col  jessup right  can we not  handle the truth   it s hard to believe  that this film was made way back in  in this post     post abu grebbe world  where our country is on a war footing the questions  that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever  the film is filled with great performances  while i am not normally a huge tom cruise fan  i have to admit  that cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer  the same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from demi moore  kevin bacon and kiefer sutherland  but what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant  dynamic performance  that comes from jack nicholson  when cruise puts nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on  you just watch in awe as nicholson just continually builds the character s palpable anger  until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous  you ca nt handle the truth  speech  even though the speech and nicholson s performance has been endlessly quoated  parodied  when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance  if you are interested in seeing a well made  movie courtroom drama  that is both thought provoking and entertaining then i highly recommend  a few good men
__label__1 i m not sure why i never watched  ghost  before until last night  for some reason  i did nt pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on tv  i m glad i gave it a chance because this is a good movie  what makes it good is its  skillful mixture of suspense  romance  comedy  and the supernatural  that would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance  i was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where i could nt wait to see what was coming next  there were a few  convenient  capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work  i m a rather pragmatic person but  by the time these things came up  i was so caught up in the story that i wanted these things to be possible  obviously  the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well  i wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching  ghost   i was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with whoopie goldberg so i want to confess that i thought her best supporting actress oscar was welldeserved  i figure that i was one of the last persons in america to see  ghost  but if there are others of you out there who still have nt seen it  give it a look  it s well worth it
__label__0 this breviary is disappointing to traditional catholics  novus ordo catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a traditional orthodox catholic who favors the roman rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations  this is the same ole same ole vatican ii  stuff
__label__1 i love every track on neyo s cd  in my own words   next let me thank neyo for bringing true rb back to the industry  i dont consider songs about cheating on your bf  gf  husband  wife rb  rb is supposed to be about love  thats why people call them slow love songs  and from    new slow love songs did nt exist  i ended up listenin to the same songs from da  s over and over until i got so tired of them  and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station  that plays mostly rap  a genre of music i dont like  to play  so sick  by neyo  it was a great song  this is literally the first and only rb album that i never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song  neyo s lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too  he is a lyrical genius  his voice is soothing and melodic  most rb albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed rb songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the cd out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the cd  but this album has all songs that are great  all of the tracks on this album are great  but here are the ones that are superb   so sick      would be a  if it was nt played over and over and with so many different versions  although i can still listen to it over and over  when you re mad      for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad  maybe for michelle rodriguez fans      get down like that     both versions   i call it  dont get down like that    this song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me   if you re not a player  and proud of being faithful  this is da song for you   sexy love      great song  um hmmm  what can i say about this one about its lyrics   oh yes  this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them  it just feels like  magic   this is da only cd dat ever deserved  stars by me  the only reason i gave other rb albums  stars is cuz i took into consideration  there was no rb album that existed that had nothing but good tracks  and most had poorly done upbeat song
__label__1 i love this camera  i have now traveled all over the usa  some places in europe  and will be using it in china  lens is excellent  i wish it were lighter weight  but ca nt have everything  and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom  i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else
__label__1 brilliant  glorious music all of it  although i agree with those who have come to feel that the ellington  strayhorn version of  quot  the nutcracker suite   quot  in particular  is an alltoooftenburied treasure that no christmas season should be without  and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year  you have more willpower than i   what happens to tchaikovsky s marvellous music and grieg s  too in these hands is creative homage of the highest order  the music is reimagined from the inside  in wholly jazz terms  in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original  what balanchine did for tchaikovsky and stravinsky in dance  ellington here does for tchaikovsky and grieg in another realm of music  and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and betterknown prototypes  and to top it all off  you get ellington and strayhorn s own superb  quot  suite thursday  quot  listen and rejoice

__label__0 if you like unimaginative phony crap you ll love this book  the proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable  an antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers  a diurnal and terrestrial mammal that for some godforsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind  primates that do nt evolve to fit man s niche  but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels  the thing has got nonsense written all over it  the  future animals  proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody  please find mr dixon a liguist  and fast  some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature s plausibility  a vortex  a posset  what jerk scientist of the future is naming these things  can he please be institutionalized  i admit the pictures were well done and preteen children would probably enjoy this immensely  i know i would ve when i was  or   and there s nothing wrong with that  it s just that dougal dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids  chains of evolution  and ecological niches  but then converts to unscientific baloney around page  all in all  i just do nt think it s cut out for people over the age of  or so  unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures  but in that case  why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution  why not pick up a copy of the dungeons and dragons monster manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures  i find that books intended to showcase the fantastic  do much better outside the realm of  somewhatboring  science
__label__1 i enjoyed high anxiety very much  i happen to be a fan of mel brooks and all his movies  it was entertaining and funny  i would suggest it to anyone
__label__0 first  i want to defend this camera s lack of an lcd viewscreen really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point  what s wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it does nt do the one thing it needs to do well ie   take a picture with the push of a button  this product would be much better if you took out all the settings  what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera  for crying out loud   and simply put in an autoflash  as it is  you must consult the manual  push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash  which is not intuitive  so you ll need to carry the manual with you   press the shutter button to turn the flash on  wait for the little red light to come on  and then you can take a picture  then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity  and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it all over again  oh  and did i mention that it wo nt take a picture if there is nt enough light  there was nt even in the brightest room in my house   so you must use the flash  clearly  the makers of this product did not test it on real children  heck  my digital camera is easier to use than this  we never even got to see the picture quality after trying to get it to even take a picture  i knew this was going back to the store asap
__label__1 truly his greatest film i have seen thus far  not only is one taken in by this movie  but it allows one to forget that it s filmed in black and white  the boy  elvis  of course  is even more beautiful in king creole  which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture  the soundtrack is admirable  he delivered it with such effervescence  such pride  one ca nt help but fall in love with him and this movie  too bad elvis was so loyal to col  parker  he could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be  this film certainly promised it
__label__1 there is not one book this woman has been involved in that i did nt like so far  many stories you will find in her book have different personalities  which i find refreshing  she has been involved in many science fiction projects and when i go to pick up a book with her name on iti know there will be something  if not everything  i will enjoy in that book  there should be no question when you see a book with her name on it  that you should open that book and read a while
__label__0 thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he s a dumb phony who does nt know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still  go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dose nt even scratc

__label__1 this recommended software is easy to load  except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication  software release  the files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection  the software was easy to use  without documentation  though documentation would have been much desired  the time to fill in the data was not too long  it took about  hours given that i had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required  the help in the software was great and insightful  i preferred using a cpa in the past  but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier  this has been a definite cost savings  efiling was easy  but make sure not to lose the cdsleeve after downloading the software  otherwise  it costs extra to efile  overall  it appears to be a great software package with great info and help  i plan to use it next year  lord willing
__label__1 i boutght this razor for my husband  he likes it  but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers  which he seems to miss a lot  i think that if he shaved more carefully  he would get these whiskers before they get too long  i think that for the price  lower end of price range   it does a pretty good job  next time  i ll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better
__label__1 these hair brushes were the rage when i was in junior high  i have had one since then  it is a great brush and lasts forever  worth the price
__label__1 i bought this to go with my msbpt shaver  i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well  i ve been using it for about  month and i could nt agree more  a quick spray on the cutters after shaving  and the next time i use it  it runs like new  i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i ve started using it  as a bonus  it seems to last quite a while  another strong product from remington
__label__0 i do nt want to spoil this movie for others and i wont  cache is french for hidden and alot was left hidden  why does the son suddenly do what he did  why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she s doing  i did nt care one bit about any of the charactors  this is a slow going movie with no conclusion  if you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry  flip a coin  i watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films  not this one
__label__1 i pretty much agree with ej rupert  but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves  i gave this album  stars for that very reason  though it was never released as a single   my block  is one of tupac s best songs  pre death row era is the best  pac in my opinion   i do nt think there s any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes red and meth s  how high  as an unquestionable classic  and this is the grimy version of how highnot the fluffy remix   i still get open to that beat  years later  though it is somewhat formulaic   poppa luv it  is still a dope cut from ll cool j  bone thugs n harmony  mary j  blige  and onyx contribute  everyday thang    everday it rains   and  live    which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion  also   sowhatyousayin   is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind  even when you get past those great tracks  you have other bangers like  kill dem all  kali ranks   glamour  glitz  a tribe called quest  and  still ca nt fade it  warren g that still make for a great listening experience  hell  even the dove shack blew up on the strength of  summertime in the lbc   and the live version of biggie s  me  my btch  is definitely different from the studio version and it s great  there s plenty to love about this album  i also agree that there are too many filler tracks   what s up star    ol  skool    domino s in the house  and  zoom zooms  wam wam  all fall under the filler category  actually  the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and i d say that only  of the album is filler  the rest is bangin  the show soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any hip hop fan  there are bangers on this album that make it a must own  if you were into hip hop around the time this came out  you remember when half of these songs were played for the first time  there are definitely some classic tracks on this album  i highly recommend it  also  for those of you that want more artists represented  check out the  rhyme  reason  soundtrack  which is pretty much similar to this  but with better collabos   you ll find a lot of artists there too  standout tracks  poppa luv it  my block  live     kill dem all  summertime in the lbc  how high  my favorite   everyday thang  everyday it rains  and me  my btch live
__label__0 this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market  after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures  the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download  it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child  the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up  even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver  the smallest one you can find  to achieve it  unfortunately  i have wasted my money but luckily you do nt have to

__label__0 i would give this product negative  stars if i could  i paid beaucoup for several very plain bras  no lace or other embelishments  and did nt wear or wash the bras until i received the brababy  i assumed the brababy would protect my bras in the wash  as that s what the product claims to do  imagine my suprise when i pulled my bras out of the washer  and out of their respective  bra demolition cages   to find them ruined  i m talking not wearable  the straps of both brand new  never worn  previously mint condition bras were hanging out all over the place and looked like they had been chewed by an animal  both bras had dents in the molded cups  then i saw that one of the bras had two noticeable rips on the cup  i nearly flipped out  i think my bras would ve been better  washed  had i thrown them into the center of a pack of rabid fighting mad dogs  the only positive thing to report is that amazon refunded my money  back to hand washing my bras and back to the mall i go to replace the ripped bra  perhaps the other with it s dented cups will be suitable for halloween

__label__1 i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny  mono phonograph  i loved it then and i love it now  rainmaker  i m on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles  i would have loved you anyway is the only song i do nt really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny  all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that s ok  the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy  i do nt care if it s the memories or not  i enjoy putting this on and turning it up
__label__0 normally i wouldnt write a review  but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share  my sister first bought the camera  and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well  shortly afterward  her screen blacked out  without any great impact or weather damage  naturally  i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way  tough luck  i then proceeded to buy one for myself  and a couple of months after i had it  my screen also inexplicably failed to work  and then for christmas  my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one  and yet again  shortly after purchase  the screen was broken  i do accept some responsibility for the damage  i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag  perhaps it got rattled around a bit  but three times  i dont find this to be a coincidence  and i do not reccomend that you risk your money  because you too may have to replace it after  months
__label__0 gitrdone is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy  larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head  but end up doubling you over with laughter  his preformance will definitely torque your brain  so be prepared  there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure  one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun  i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls do nt fart  they do nt even have buttholes  he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever  unless you are an idiot  you know you ca nt look like him without a strict training regiment  nice try larry  he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful antihillary clinton piece  this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary  i think larry the cable guy
__label__1 i am very pleased with the product  i had trouble with my system and microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues

__label__0 while microsoft tries very hard to make office  think ahead of me   they almost always seem to get it wrong  the result is a package that consistently annoys me  it is true that one can turn off the  helpful  hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering  however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody s business  in my opinion  office   was an excellent package  and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill  as with many people  i use office at work because i have no choice  at home i ve had good luck with staroffice from sun  while not perfect  staroffice has read and created files compatible with microsoft office very consistently in my experience  and it s a whole lot less expensive  i am therefore hesitant to recommend microsoft office professional edtition  to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of excel and  or need to use access database frequently
__label__0 good  motor drive speed  grip feel  takes nikon lenses  reacts fast to pressing the shutter release  bad  skin tone renditions a color other than skin  white balance does nt balance well  noise at anything above iso   looks like  cf card door tough to open  screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot  battery cover is not part of the battery  button placement not as intuitive as on the d mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements  dumped mine a month after i got it
__label__1 to all  i just purchased the spuz after searching for the best camera bang for the buck  olympus fills the bill       was my first day of use and i decided to check all the features  with the batteries supplied  still in use and a gb card  i took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park   pictures  including several  fps and  fps shoots and three videos     and  seconds in length  i am not a pro and will be using this camera for sports  vacations and every day family events  no cons yets  i love the  scn  feature  just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera  all you have to do is take the picture
__label__0 nothing in this book was usable for me  okay  very little  if i was trying to write the next ethan frome  then this book would be perfect  instead i write scifi and fantasy  i was looking for tips to improve my description of things  this book recommends describing different things  too much emphasis on metaphor  which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious   if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate  this book might be a waste of your time  however  poets and pureliterary writers might find it more useful than i did
__label__0 hr block does a much better job marketing software than writing it  i used the online version  had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later  after about an hour of painfully slow entry  sometimes just one item per page  most of the time looking at  loading  please wait  i had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save  no luck  repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error  and i could not save without registering  finally just left the computer on and left  when i came back taxcut had timed out and lost all my data  by the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your email to other companies  even if you select no you will get frequent emails from hr block  i will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year  when a company ca nt get something simple like this right  it calls into question everything they do

__label__0 no one questions lyrics born s talent  which can be matched by few  his breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio  except then if you go see him do it live  recommended  he is a charismatic performer  you realize they didnt  the problem with this release is not  therefore  lyrics born himself  it s just that there s not enough interesting things happening around him  there are handful of standout songs on this record  but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does  the skits remind me why i sometimes think the whole idea of skits on cds tired itself out in about   if not earlier  worse  the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable  making the whole album kind of drag  and the grooves  guitar licks and keys  all of which are good in small doses  become sort of flat after a time  especially when joyo velarde is nt singing backup vox  surely a few of the songs could have become bsides on the single  or something  instead of bloating the album itself  do that there  rise and shine  and one session are my favorite tracks  the ones i would say go buy from the itunes store or something right now  there s nothing wrong with the rest  i just do nt find myself listening to them much  i like the concept of later that day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to
__label__0 great fan of the man they call  sugar  zucchero  but this outing is really below par  this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs  with the addition of other famous singers  did he send the original recordings to these people  en did they ad little pieces here and there  it sounds like it  none of the songs have gotten  better compared to the originals  to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money  and get more attention for  sugar  outside of italy    do nt buy it  get  oro    shake  or  blue sugar  instead
__label__0 this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms  story  and it s hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children  even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale  the king threatens to kill the miller s daughter if she ca nt spin gold from straw  rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her  but extracts a necklace  a ring and  on the third night of spinning  a promise of her firstborn  she then marries the king  whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome  when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn  rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name  she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name  so the king  though he looks good  is greedy and brutal  the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life  and then depends on an anonymous  unrecognized  servant girl  to save the child  and rumpelstiltskin  shown as physically unattractive and  the message seems to be  therefore bad  is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for  a weird  twisted story that offers nothing for kids  illustrated with renaissancestyle pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad
__label__0 i m a  compleat  beatlemaniac  and i do nt mind the political statements at all  but this is a nearly unlistenable record that i have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album  i would have loved it if it had been a   single   woman is the nigger of the world   with the rest of it just words written in liner notes  after that opening track  the remainder is a serious chore to get through  it s almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent  imagine     and the solid  mind games      but then again  john was not consistent  in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star  love john for the genius he was  his commitment to peace  and the great music he made   it s just that there s barely any of it on this particular record
__label__0 this collection of poems  tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson s works  is in final assessment a crime against the poet s great talent  as is freely admitted in the introduction  the editor  mr higginson   quot  worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter  changing the line arrangements  and rewriting the dialect of the local area  quot  this is a free admission of the book s guilt  having adulterated dickenson s original poems in both content and form  gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers  gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems  meanings  and  worst of all  gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist  as thomas h  johnson says in the introduction to  quot  the complete poems of emily dickenson   quot  a representative midnineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman    which he was not equipped to estimate  quot  do yourself a favor and avoid this text  instead  find one that is true to the original poems  one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author  and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson

__label__0 i got to get it off my chest  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful  but  the camera has several down sides   as all have said  it eats batteries big time  this is a pain   it recharges slow between flash and between non flash  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment   not durable  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable  any suggestions
__label__1 ms melua is from georgia  her voice is quite like the swede  lisa ekdahl  neither has range or power  both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse  both have musical partners  in ms melua s case it is mike batt who is to her what nelson riddle was to linda rondstadt  except that  in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching  he writes songs  most of this album are her and  or his songs  they are well written and well treated  they are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners  mr batt  among many other things  worked with steeleye span and art garfunkel long ago  the original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition  but my favorite cut is her rendering  blues in the night   which some might remember from looney tunes cartoons many decades past   my mama done tole me   it starts  knowing she cannot belt it  instead she works it  one short note on steve sale s engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all  clipping  perhaps because i bought it on vinyl  but i hear none of these defects  my set is revealing  and it reveals excellent engineering  considering the largeish ensemble mr batt has assembeled  fear not  unless the cd really is badly made
__label__1 over  years after it was published  the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo  bubba s  jacques  un s buddy yasser  in lebanon is no less important  interestingly  lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation  they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists  another killed last week      in this review  i will attempt to explain the story  the leftwing  doves reporter s views  and on so many levels his mistakes   and most importantly to americans who love and support israel  the correlation between israel s actions and our  war on terror   first to the journalists  the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz zeev schiff  as the brilliant reviewer givbatam points out nearby  mr schiff is a member of the israeli left  dove  peace now group  this  coalition  consists of myopic people  with all due respect  that do nt seem to understand good and evil  just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the  axis of evil   he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud   these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our  their enemies  this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority  it is this  authority  that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize  fittingly  arafat walked away from the clinton  barak plan in   which would have created a palestinian state  which to this day    does not exist despite the charade of the road map  the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon  most of the books i ve read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon  he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel  i do nt live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation  but he was democratically elected  so most of the voters must disagree with the left s assessment of mr sharon  yes  i know his  disengagement  is an illegal abomination  more on that later  wear orange to support the settlers   on page   mr zeev describes sharon as  a cynical  headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievementsand not necessarily defensive onesand a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power   those would prove to be the  kindest  words he would have for mr sharon  on page   he accuses sharon of implementing a quasicoup detat  and on and on it goes  the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government  details forthcoming  later on  we learn of the  courageous  freedom fighter   my emphasis  arafat s decision to deploy all palestinians including  year old boys to kill israelis  of course  to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians  the best nonchild attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors  nurses using  bomber pants   great video of her discovering the bomb would nt activate  however us msm mainstream media other than fox refused to air it   on page   we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen s  the same oslo and road map violating  terrorist supporting  enabling  holocaust denying  chainsmoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house  recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder  throughout the story  if indeed the cabinet was mislead  we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences  specifically  a failure to call up the reserves  to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk  pity the nation  and thomas friedman  ny times  from lebanon to jerusalem   mr schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by rayban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo  on page   we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action  in this episode  three children were gunned down in front of their father  on page   the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members  in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation  the author s ask  was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries   and further   how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem    are you kidding me   these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace  meanwhile  the un  the left  doves  the media  and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat s involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation  in my humble view  something had to be done  prime minister begin agreed with sharon s initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut  page  features more america bashing  culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe  the story of the military operation is detailed completely  and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla  i ll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation  but in short  israel relied on their  allies  in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists  most assuredly  after the palestinians brought havoc to these people  they wanted revenge  the result  some civilian deaths to go along with the  clean up  operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon  folks  war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan  many to this day say that is why we allegedly  lost  bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border  general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry  kedwards crowd  our  ally  pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence  given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban  as for the author s attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon  it did nt work  he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation  after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in  and launched  restarted the intifada  israel voted for  arik  and his platform of not negotiating with arafat  sadly  no tragically  he is haphazardly implementing his  disengagement plan   six weeks prior to its start  it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it  moreover  turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel s destruction  israel expects terror gangs of hamas  islamic jihad  and mazen s own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations  so looking back mr schiff and yaari  who was right  terror coddling doves such as rabin  who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat  and peres or likud hawks such as sharon  and netanyahu   let the reader decide  i know who i would trust with my security  likud members sharon and netanyahu
__label__1 i enjoyed this book for the most part  i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the  quot  mountainquot   the main characters were all there  participating in the problem solving  there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode  and some food for thought added in as well  is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there  i do nt know but this book presents some interesting questions  i await the next book in the series
__label__1 recieved product on time  and i wil for sure order from this company agai
__label__0 this product just does nt cut my nose hair as close as the panasonic it replaced  if i could remember the model of the panasonic  i would mention it in this review  i hope i can find the manual for the panasonic so i can get another one  beware that many of the new designs are going this rout  even panasonic   the manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration  but i think its more of a liability issue on their part  someone probably got sued for a nicked nose   i just wo nt buy their products anymore if they re going to design them for marginal performance
__label__1 i like this product a lot  my hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath  i used this product and my hair looks good now  it looks smooth and straight now and i can feel the softness when i touch my hair  i definitely will recommend this product to my friends
__label__1 hard  smart  creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days  even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us  finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch  thankfully   secrets   under the usually readily available columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for  should this be a hard decision  emphatically  no  although i can see where previous reviewers are coming from  trying to compare this outing to headhunters is truly unnecessary  with this   effort herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz  funk and disco but it all works   doin it  is a super  super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the  manchild  sessions  and although  gentle thoughts  can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album  it s got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and  as always  herbie dancing on the keys  go get  secrets   do nt think about it  it ll always be an easy goto funk bomb just when you need a little infusion
__label__1 this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased  the pictures are wonderful  the initial downloading process was straighforward and problemfree  we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do  the slideshow feature is wonderful as well  everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed  to be sure  they are expensive but worth the cost  we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly  thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right
__label__0 i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys  with tweedy s songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris  departure from the jayhawks  i was hoping we d see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris   rainy day music  was released  now  while there are some really good songs here  nothing really comes close to the  redheaded stepchilds    radio kings   or  jennifer save mes   the album lacks something but i ca nt put my finger on it  it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus  considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around  drinking beer  and goofing off  this album feels wrong  it does nt have that singalong feel  with the exception of possibly one or two songs  that the first couple albums  and even ep  had  just a little lackluster and  considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one  almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throwaways
__label__0 this is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but does nt understand him  her  i was expecting some new information about a  secret language   there was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog  so what s the  secret   i agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip  the author says that cats do not get lonely  well  that s wrong  he also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served  how does one explain cats who live with homeless street people  the title was deceiving

__label__1 this is the first slr camera that i have ever owned  i bought it because i was going on a trip around the world  wanted a nice camera  and had it recommended by a camera shop owner  it is extremely easy to use  so easy that i could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries i visited  point to the button they needed to push and i ended up with a great picture  i did nt need to explain a thing  i also did nt mind carrying it around all day  it is very light for its size  i have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures  i have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera  from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great  the action shots are never blurry  the only complaint that i have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting  sometimes it is slow and sometimes it wo nt work at all  in these cases i just turn on the manual focus option  all the options that the camera has are great  but to be honest i rarely use them  i ve found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center  if i know that i m going to be taking action shots or landscapes i will set the camera to that mode  but often i forget and my pictures still look great  i think that this is an excellent camera  especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a slr camera can give them  there are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses  so when the photography bug gets you  this camera can stay with you
__label__1 almost a classic in my book  we bumped this on the southside of chicago when this dropped  these two were like a west coast epmd because they blended perfectly  u could tell them apart easily because gangsta d had the eazye voice with the hard lyrics  while kk had a gruff voice and was a str clown  kk would say anything  once again the whole crew is on this one also  quik  hic  and amg  they had a tight click that just seemed to from voltron how they worked together  my favorites on this album are  if u want it  be true  yourself  let the rhythm  and just ai nt me  kk solo   i still take hoodrats on  triple mmm shots  listen to the album to find the meaning  hotep
__label__1 i bought this cd before going to see mmw  with john scofield  for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec    i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue s website  so i bought a ticket and wanted to get  out louder   which i knew they were going to play  to familiarize myself  but the store i was at was out of it  so i bought  end of the world  instead  while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first  i still liked the overall funkiness of it all  theni saw them play  you must see them play   i did nt ever want it to end  i immediately wanted to see them again  it s less than a week later and i have  more cd s   out louder  and scofield s  agogo  which they  back  him on  and  more on the way from amazon as i m writing this  i m like an addict now  i have to have them on in the car and in the house  i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they re on and all is right with my world again  i must say i like  out louder  and even  agogo  better than  end of the world   but only slightly  it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players  and i do like it better after a few listens  i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians

__label__1 a few years ago  i had the pleasure of meeting pam munoz ryan at a summer arts children s storytelling forum held at california state university  fresno  she read the book to parents  teachers  and students who attended the conference  i was amazed on the writing  culture  and illustrations that she used for this book  the novel serves as a tale of her childhood spending time with her family at her grandmother s house  overall  the story teaches children the value of traditions  family  and heritage  in short   mice and beans  is a good book to read
__label__0 i purchased this case for my dscs i hate it  it is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else  there is no handle to the case  in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle  the zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so i do nt recommend doing this  look for a better case for your new camera

__label__0 the best thing i can say about the test is it took  days to receive my results  the actual results varied greatly from those i received from my doctor  months prior     both tests were taken following a hour fast  all instructions were followed  i find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in  months  i contacted biosafe customer service  all representatives were busy on my first call so i left a message  which was not returned  i called again and was able to speak to someone right away  the customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods  finger prick vs blood drawn from arm  will vary  slightly      i question the accuracy of the biosafe results

__label__1 the canon rse is all that canon says it isit is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash  focus  then release the shutter once  a multiple of times  or hold it open for bulb exposure  although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture  it was simple enough to make an  extension  that allows for very remote exposures
__label__1 i have to say that i have been converted  for over  years now i lived with a razor  i have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too  i am the kind of guy that gets a  oclock shadow at noon  i have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the  blade  i have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the gillette brand is the best type of razor  but now i find it s not the best shave  i used an electric shaver several years back  it was one of the top of the line norelco with the incorporated gel  it gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs  i ended up having to shave as normal   true story  i am a manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item i was marked bad was my personal appearance  not that i dress bad or not wear deodorant  but that they felt i did nt shave often   i shave at the very least every other day  usually every day   so i felt i had to so something about it  i researched electric shavers thinking i could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer  i found that panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had  the instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about  days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut  i have been using it for almost  days now  and i will not live without it  i have never had this close of a shave before  i can actually go  days without getting a shadow  my fiancé has found a new love for touching my face  and i seem to be getting more kisses too  during the first  weeks i had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old gillette  but today officially i was able to through my gillette away for good   my boss has even asked what i am doing different and when i told him  he went out and bought one too  he also loves it now  my fiancé said she would leave me if i stopped using the panasonic  it s a good thing panasonic has been around for decades  so  i am raving about his product  but every good has its bad  what the bad  well  it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave  but for the amount of time i am planning to use it and the money i am saving from buying razors every month  i can handle that  the cleaning system is very good  but it takes very long to clean   hrs  and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles  the cleaning cartage is said to last  months whether you use it once a day or one a week  i have not gotten to that point yet  but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash  i just end up using the base for the drying cycle  which is an option  the batter is very good  in the month i have used it  i have charged it twice but it really did nt need it as it said the charge was good  overall  excellent product  could there be a better shaver out there  maybe  will i ever know  at this time  i am not worried about it  i am very satisfied with this panasonic  and do nt think it can get any better  this product does not include the cleaning base  i do recommend it as even if you do nt use it to clean the razor  you can use it to dry it  it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying  but  if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor  this is it
__label__1 be careful when you use this lens because it does not have is  image stabilizer  so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than    of a second you are going to going to get some blur  this is why the lens is so cheap  this is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens  if you are really zoomed in and it s cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case  this goes for any lens  but if you will be using the mm end of this then use a tripod  it s common sense  but i ve loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards
__label__1 high iso and large screen were the reasons for my purchase  the screen is great but  when you force the iso   it seems to darken the pictures more than in  i have a s and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an iso is set w  o having to go to full manual option  definitely something to improve  the auto option seems to work much better and i was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works  also  the two picture function  it takes two with slightly different sets automatically  saves me on a lot of  reposing

__label__1 i read about lila downs  new cd  la cantina  in victor cruz  lugo s article entitled   sweet sorrow   published in the junejuly  issue of hispanic magazine  page    it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs  new cd  la cantina   the cd cover is awesome  a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative midair pause with her guitarra ready to rock  it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time  awakening the historicallyoppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song   each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila s lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicanochicanohualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family   i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera s legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in  juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her downtoearth talented voice  later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i ve been a fan of her work ever since   this new cd is indeed a delightful experience  i appreciate that she moved into the corrido  son  etc genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more  it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious  it s authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity  i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila s work  she is a true artist  i ve always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds  however  this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience   i am very impressed with lila s voice and how it has matured since the summer of  there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon  ahua  her solos in  yo ya me voy   have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity  as victor cruzlugo writes   through it all  downs  powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart  tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same   this is my favorite of lila s repertoire  it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed  enjoy
__label__1 i purchased this kit  primarily for the extra battery  which retails for about what i paid for this item  having the backup battery is great  but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case  it protects my dscp  without being bulky or heavy  with the camera being so small  it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money  the case for the memory sticks is nice as well  it is easy to lose a stick if it s just floating around and the case keeps them securely  all in all  this is an excellent value
__label__0 i recommend that you not buy this product through the mail  my three boxes leaked all over the amazon box  yuck
__label__0 i purchased dick cavett s john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great  it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material  i gained new insight about john and yoko  so i bought cavett s interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar  the  minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix  included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock  the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best
__label__0 i deinstall the product after two weeks of use  it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents  if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing  also  the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often nonfunctional
__label__0 i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts  but i did nt even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust  almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments  as i was flipping through the book  i found xrated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book  i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore  and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
__label__0 i remember listening to this years ago  and i thought i would add this to my cd library  now i know why it has been years sense i ve listened to it   very sqeaky  dull  slow paced stuff  bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil
__label__0 the powershot a on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera
__label__0 la grange is probably at the top of most zz top fans lists  and rightly so as it is superb  but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track  which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording  it is so awful that i do nt know how anybody can listen to it  thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for rancho texicano  clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here  dummies  also  waitin  on the bus  jesus just left chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
__label__1 based on the description  i expected this to be a davinci code knockoff  but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy  comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice  this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it s own right  i enjoyed the characters  plot  and switching between the past and present  i m not sure it has literary value  i would nt argue that the davinci code does  either   but it s certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow
__label__0 i was also disappointed with this dvd  as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers  i think the title   yoga for beginners  is misleading  as this dvd contains many advanced yoga routines  also  on the back of the dvd it said it contained a  core workout  min   but no such workout is actually on the dvd  i purchase the  pilates for inflexible people  at the same time as this dvd  and i much prefer it  although  i wish i d known that two of the workouts from the pilates dvd were on the yoga dvd before i bought them both
__label__1 this is such an good industrial album  that i was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that i wanted to use seemed not good enough  however  if i have to put one then it has to be these  brilliant  astounding  stupendous and awesome  this is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time  the first track is good and then it just gets better and better  in fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track  the booklet is ok but the lyrics are missing  but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing  minphaser  life line  guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds  bets and samples  the keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music
__label__0 my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school  it was nt until years later that i saw it  and i was horrified    this was a movie aimed at children    what does a children s movie need a sexy bunny for  the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and  strutting her stuff  on the basketball court in a very provocative manner  until the male characters were panting  drooling  and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick  depraved perverts  this scene was highly innapropriate for children  and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls  not only that  the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities  this movie should be kept far  far away from children  and was truly deserving of zero stars
__label__1 the real life base  dr li chingyun    adds to the wonder and mystery  many movies usually pale compared to the book  however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic  such as excellent film footage for the time  even though some scenes are missing  when i look at the shangrila setting some times my mind wanders and i wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book  atlas shrugged  by ayn rand  i doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts  these actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played  a later remake of this movie was ok but just did not have the presence of these actors  now the dvd features  digitally remastered audio  anamorphic video production notes restoration before and after comparison three deleted scenes photo documentary with narration by historian kendall miller many more by the way i personally enjoy watching and rewatching this movie
__label__1 i was pleaed at how quickly i began to pick up on the language  i plan to purchase other rosetta stone products in the futur
__label__1 this was a great dvd i bought it for my husband and he loved it  there were a few episodes that we never saw and the outakes were really funny  i definately would recomend
__label__1 when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark  starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights  but by the music she sang and how she deeply  richly portrayed those songs  she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well  i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her musicshe truly is addicting once you hear these songsthese songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey
__label__0 i bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in cnet  however  i just bought a new dell inspiron e that shipped with windows vista home premium  and zonealarm  is flat out incompatible with the new os  i downloaded zonealarm  and that is flat out incompatible as well  i m sure this is a great security suite for windows xp  but beware if you have vista  there seems to be no update on their website when zonelabs will release a vista compatible zonealarm   they mention something about  after january    but it s march  for crying out loud   so there s my purchase price of a good product down the drain
__label__0 the product does not work as it is shown on tv  there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy  the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust
__label__1 i have been waiting for this dvd to come out for a very long time  it is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the bradley war tank  it shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used  even if they were not acceptable for use  and the struggle of one man to do the right thing  you will not stop laughing while watching this movie
__label__1 i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case  if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product  great quality nevertheless
__label__0 this is not at all suitable for young children  it s awkward and difficult to use  we re sending it back  totally inappropriate for children
__label__1 was surprised by the price compared to other movies  but it was worth it
__label__1 he d always had problems with frequent canker sores  after he tried this  on a recommendation from his dentist   his canker sores went from   week  to   year
__label__0 i am an alice fan  so this is far far from my favorite  the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie is nt scary  the other is because it would be enchanting for a  year old or another youngster that does nt know anything about wonderland  my  year old even got bored with this  kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning  and in  she was much too young to be and definitely looked so  she just did nt look well in this movie  and everything looked so cheap and fake  the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out  i would not recommend this  i would recommend the  american mini series of alice in wonderland  it is my absolute favorite  with martin short as the mad hatter  and a long list of big names  that one is fun for all ages
__label__0 i do nt know who these people are  but they will give praise for anything  ms london is a wonderful singer  but the producers must have given her sleeping pills  this is a boring cd  like peggi blu  who won star search  her record company  toned her down  for her debut album  with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip  hop  dum de dum  mary j  blige beat  which will send you to nowheresville  aretha franklin s boring so damn happy was so awful  it s no longer available  she went  mary j   and almost lost the crown off her head  because she s aretha franklin  queen of soul  she did manage  somehow  to get a nondeserved grammy for  wonderful  from that cd  the grammys also presented the queen with her th competitive grammy for her  a house is not a home  mess  what must they be thinking  well  latoya london wo nt be considered for anything for this hip  hop mess  she should get serious about some r  b  i mean the real r  b  and leave this lightweight fluff alone  latoya  you have a great voice   use it  contact sam dees  jo armstead or ashford  simpson and beg for some material  and  as madame rose would say   sing out  louise
__label__1 a great program  pretty easy to use  you have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do  i bought it usedfrom a list on amazon and it was fine  really like the program  linda j johnso
__label__1 these are a helpful item for me  the cloth pockets are nice  and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple
__label__1 purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one  i put the new drive in a usb external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software  in about  minutes and  mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly  i have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup  the menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward
__label__0 this poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of sister north  in the end  we really do nt care if she ever returns  the ending is cliched and predictable  a waste of time
__label__0 the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over  i brought them home and there is fog inside  also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get toand it is on the lens  i called bushnell s help line and they told me   well  it is nt internally fog proof  just externally  when asked about the stuff on the inside   that is probably fungus  that sometimes happens  i just bought the binoculars    he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out  avoid these at all costs    they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
__label__1 was pleased to receive the kodak schneiderkreuznach xenar x mm telephoto lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants  i do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the kodak p the kodak p is a great camera and takes excellent pictures  by adding the kodak schneiderkreuznach xenar x mm telephoto lens to the p  it makes already great pictures even better  and what clarity  i recommend this product to everyone
__label__1 i gotta be honest  when i first listened to this album i was dissapointed  but like any truly amazing album  it just took some decoding  listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing  essentially  gat are four people who are amazing at what they do  and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly  their first album  emphasizer  blew me away  but i felt it lost steam around halfway through  this album does no such thing  and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album  which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for  this gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department  but dont get me wrong  this cd sounds amazing  anyway  i saw them live last night in nyc  and they blew my mind  i recommend this cd to anyone  and see them live if you get the rare opportunity
__label__0 i have been using this cord for about a year  and i had problems with its durability  it actually worked fine for a for the first  months  but then it started to fall apart  when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket  the thin plastic shoe  where the flash is attached to  developed a crack and eventually broke off  making it useless to mount the flash  i had to buy a replacement part from canon  who charged me  for this small plastic piece   i flipped the flash carefully from then on  but then it still cracked   i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic  so far  there is no response  a few months later  the cord  for some unknown reason  makes my ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode  and making the flash fire at full power  overexposing the entire image  i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera s hotshoe  and the flash worked fine  switching back to the ettl mode  for a piece of equipment from canon  it s hard to imagine it giving so many problems  it s like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories  as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord  i am forced to get another one and hope for the best
__label__1 this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer  i have paid alot more for more well known  brand named dryers  i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past  buy this hair dryer  you wo nt be sorry
__label__0 i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery  i have better than average hand and arm strength  but i found this particular model to be hard to operate  i ca nt imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it   normal sized cans  like soup or beans  slipped out of its pitiful grip  i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash  this is definitely a lightweight  too light for much real use  i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more
__label__1 leather wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper  because  you know  a dvd makes good toilet paper  maybe it s why he s so grumpy   i would suggest purchasing it and watching it  michael moore may be more to the left than some  but god  has nt anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye  it s less biased than the news is  he reports  you decide  and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion  but werent  michael moore is far more honest than the republican talking heads  rush  coulter  hannity   watch  enjoy  investigate further
__label__1 this movie is great  very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud  love it
__label__0 you ca nt print on anything over x paper  useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale   i bought this thinking that it would be better than my  version  of broderbund d home architect  it turns out that this is exactly the same software  i strongly recommend looking for something better
__label__0 i purchased  through work  the powershot s in july of  i ve always owned nikon products personally  but the features for the price of the s swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty  in the  months i ve had the s  it s been sent to the factory twice for repairs the second time was just  days before the warranty expired  the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track  eight months later  the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again  the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np  so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning  now  the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open  i have no faith in the canon s and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole  the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within  weeks  which i thought was fast for warranty work
__label__1 this the best product out there for preventing and ridding red bumps  ingrown hairs  and the other unslightly skin  hair irritations
__label__1 love letters has a very simple concept  two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage  they never look at each other  but within these letters is so much humor  love  and truth that the play will carry you away with delight  i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore  i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i d heard so much about it  after page three  i did nt want to put it down  now i m buying it for a friend  do nt think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romancenovel fodder  if you have ever been in love  you will recognize parts of yourself in this  it always stays true to its welldrawn characters  which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful
__label__0 i purchased turbo tax after reading the reviews heresomeone had mentioned a glitch  but someone else mentioned a work around  bottom line  if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop  you re fine  but if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule  business aspects of your tax return  get ready for a huge problemit does nt let you back in  i went to their website where they had both a work around  and a report that if you update your turbo tax  very easy  the glitch will be fixed  not so  it did nothing for me  then i tried the workaroundsi got back in once but the next time i tried to use the work around a few days later  it did not work  i ended up having to call an accountant  week before the th and thank goodness i was able to get an appointment  also  if you have a business and do nt understand some of the tax workings  like depreciation  it is very difficult to translate your former accountant s previous year s work into the new turbotax  it s not set up that way  so you need to know what you re doing  i have a college degree and a lot of sticktoitness  but i could not figure out and be sure that i was entering things correctly  and then  it did nt matter anyway  as i could nt get in to change anything in the end  finally  make sure you save  save  save as you go  while doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already  i logged into their website to get some support  when i  x  ed out of the internet page  it closed my turbotax screen that i d opened on my computer  guess what  it was all lost and i had to start from the beginning  that was before i was even impacted by the  glitch  later  this program does not remind you to save when you close  or ask you if you want to save  so be sure and save all the time  so  good luck to anyone who tries this  for me  it was a huge disappointment and i am returning it to amazon for a refund due to the glitch  i honestly do nt know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem
__label__1 i read les miserables after i saw the opera  and it has inspired in me more than any book i ve ever read  i do nt believe one could ever find a better novel anywhere  for everyone out there read this now   there is a character that will touch everyone  no matter what type of person you are  this novel is easy to relate to  and exciting  it also give some insight to the unwritten history of the revolutions in france during napolean s time  i recommend strongly to everyone to read this book  and see the opera  it really will effect your life
__label__0 this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film  and has many flaws  a silly plot  cheap religious imagery  dracula is judas  jeez louise   and not one truly sexy or scary moment  and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula s brides  including jennifer esposito  jeri ryan  if you ca nt make a film sexy with these two  you re in the wrong business  craven has an over inflated rep as a director  he does nt deserve any rep as a producer  if this leaden film is a sample  it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison  save your money and pick up something scary instead  like bava s black sunday or any hammer horror
__label__0 i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book  article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that  having said that i did not like this book    the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times  i had to reread many sentences to understand lewis  point    the story lacked the depth of lewis  other wonderful books  where s the who  why  what that lewis used to moneyball  and others  educational  i wanted the story behind the story    who were all the pictures of  i found them distracting  i ll continue to read lewis  books bu thope the next one is bette
__label__0 a pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book  i wanted to strangle him  repetitive  condescending  overly simplified and so booooorrring    here is the nuts of it all  pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask  buy  shares and then sell it    higher right away  everything else is simply preamble  over and over and over  hope i saved you  bucks
__label__1 this lens is great  i ve been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful  the only downside is the lack of ability to zoom  other than that it s a great lens
__label__1 this is lovely stuff  the other reviews say why much better than i can  but i just had to add to the adoration
__label__0 very disappointed in this product and amazon s response to the problem  item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included  this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed  they have told me they ca nt supply the missing part  the metal neck strap showing in the photo  as item comes from a freight forwarder  i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country
__label__0 i was the commander of my highschools afjrotc rocket club so my godfather bought em this book it is very informative but if you are just building basic este kits then this is way to advanced for you as it was for me and the other cadets in the club but if you are really into rockets this book is for yo
__label__0 first of all  the trailer was the best part of the movie  had me expecting a totally different story  second  the story i got turned out to be the  grinch who stole christmas  crossed with  it s a wonderful life   the latter of which was even more boring than this hokey remake   does nt that therefore make  santa clause   so cliche  so done before   third  the kids in the audience seemed to enjoy it  but man was i bored    i actually enjoyed the original santa clause  so i ca nt blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids  movie   fourth  i found the christmas council to be extremely offensive  read  inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about christmas   whoop  whoop  whoop  spoiler alert  spoiler alert  read no farther if you have nt already seen the movie   fifth  i found jack frost s conversion to be  zzzzzzzzzzz whazzat  oof  i must have dozed off for a minute  sorry  now what was i saying  oh yeah  poor  pitiful  evil jack frost   ho hum  would nt it have been much better to kill him off than convert him  i mean  come on  is the converted jack frost supposed to be an improvement  yucky  he s disgusting  i liked him much better as a villain  better hair  better duds  i say  just freeze him off next to a wooly mammoth  be done with him  or bring him back in next year s sequel  because you know there s going to be one   for goodness  sake  do we always have to embrace our inner icicle   hurl   sixth   not only jack   but there was so much about this movie that just did nt make sense   yawn  okay  i m done with it  it s not even worth the time i took for it
__label__0 the new systemworks has a horrible interface  you ca nt see what your options are easily  you ca nt see the status of your components  you ca nt see what version you have  when you load it after loading norton personal firewall   the firewall will not load program rules  you have to uninstall the firewall and then reinstall it   i m not sure how the protection works  but the software  redesign  was done by an ergonomic moron
__label__0 some products lead to real improvement of your skin  retin a  exfoliators  while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up  the sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement  the regenerist contains silicones that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup  such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow s feet are smaller  if you really want to do a test  you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash  if during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works  you ca nt really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello  and another thing  a wrinkle ca nt be erased in one or  weeks  the skin does nt produce collagen that fast  unless you cut it   paying    oz  retail price  its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price  for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better  try monistat soothing care  chafing relief powder gel  oz   at cvs  i have been using matrixyl  the active peptide in regenerist  for  months in my own formulations  without silicones  and frankly speaking have nt noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead  currently there is only one study of the effects of matrixyl conducted by sederma  the manifacturer of matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story

__label__1 i ve had this digital camera for almost a year  it s the fourth camera i ve owned  i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere  being an amateur photographer  and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others   i did nt want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera  it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse  for formal nights out   the size and weight of this camera is its best feature  and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera  too  this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items online to landscape scenery  my pictures have always turned out beautifully  with wonderful color and crispness  i have discovered that the  automatic  lighting feature is not always the most ideal  but you can reprogram just about anything on this camera  it s really quite a good camera  and given its price these days with the newer generations out there  it s a steal
__label__0 attempted to upgrade from  to  bad move  none of my access  programs work now  in fact i  i brought home a  access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions  nope  the upgrade just did nt workhad to purchase a full version to set things right  save your money on this product

__label__0 the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz  and by extension the fz which has an identical body   i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out  if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca nt fit in the bag at all  there s also no padding to speak of with this case  by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure  padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again  targus makes decent laptop cases  but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently  apparently it does fit some cameras  just not the panasonic fzs  considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
__label__1 this is not a chick flick movie  this is not a movie for baseball fans  this movie is for everyone  it has romance  it has sports  it has a great soundtrack  it makes you laugh  it makes you cry  it makes you think  it is a feel good movie

__label__1 the beautiful young brooke shields plays    year old violet  daughter of hattie  susan sarandon  a new orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in  violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world  when she turns   her virginity is auctioned off  brooke shields  portrayal of violet is poignant and beautiful  her childish charms and innocence are so heartwrenchingly sweet  the scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer s bed  very childlike  and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose  forehead etc and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings  i just wanted to jump into the tv and give her a hug   this  mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene  and others  is particularly poignant as we know that young violet is merely reciting what she s heard from the prostitutes  the photographer also says that violet does nt know what she s saying  you just want to turn the clock back  hug violet and give her a proper childhood  the photographer marries her because he s fascinated with her beauty  innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute  the part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he s trying to give back her childhood  sadly she s been exposed to too much  too soon in her life  susan sarandon and brooke shields are wonderful in this movie as well as keith carradine  the photographer  the art aspect  music soundtrack are amazing  this movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as  normal  which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to  rescue  young violet
__label__0 not to be disrespectful but are you people for real  i ca nt believe this book is getting  and  stars  there was nothing good about this book  a bunch of people in the book did not even matter  bill kendall s wife  the new anchor man pete whatever his last name was  the boss yelena  eliza s boyfriend  the priest  even the soontobepresident and his wife  i mean what s the point in even mentioning them  they were not involved in the main events  she did nt even talk about what happened to them at the end  the judge is the only one that matters  and she did nt even write about him all that much  really disappointing  as i said i do nt mean to be disrespectful  but to give this book stars  you must have read either bedtime stories all your life  or not have read anything  don  t waste your money that s all i have to say  sorr

__label__1 there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album  one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time  it was the first rock album recorded on a  track  in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology  the remaster is splendid  another good reason is the great bonus tracks  almost  minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store  can you dig it
__label__0 here s the good news  i have had many cameras in my life  digital and film  and i have found the z to be my favorite  the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color  my previous camera was a minolta dimage     and i found that this camera s photo quality was just as good  the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily  owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life  here s the bad news  recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair  the service was terrible  their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support  summary  great camera as long as it does nt break  it s easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it
__label__0 i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son s fast growing hair  he s got thick hair that we like to keep  buzzed  short  the first time i used the clippers  he complained that they really pull at the hair  i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed  the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair  i ve decided to send it back  reasonably priced but not worth the pain  not recomended for thick hair
__label__1 i love the new digital canon  the only problem is it s not nearly as tough as it s film twin  i had the camera less than a month when the popup flash quit working  the canon people have been great  and very helpful  but i d rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory  the photos  however  are wonderful  film quality for the most part  printable and enlargable   it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the mm telephoto but i hike with it  so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos
__label__1 i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my pastshoulderlength hair  it works great  i gotta admit  it s just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the  extra large  size towel  which is nt really all that large
__label__1 great compact design  takes up very little room in your suitcase  rollers heat up  are ready to use in about  minutes like the product claims  sets hair better then most rollers  and i have tried many   the only thing that i would change  is to add  more rollers  but i liked these rollers so much  i actually bought a nd set  use these at home over the  other sets of rollers i own
__label__0 does nt work on mac like it says that it does louses up your machine not worth i
__label__1 like many amazon reviewers  i play a teensy bit of guitar  i know just enough to know how incredible these guys are  this is the best  most exciting acoustic playing i ve heard since al dimeola cut  race with devil on spanish highway  on his elegant gypsy suite lp  watching the del castillo brothers shred on the dvd part of this set will assure that i do nt get anywhere near my guitar for a long time  since robert rodriguez  desperado  spy kids  etc  filmed the performances  we get appallingly good  tight shots of the fretwork  people  it ca nt be done  i will henceforth concentrate on harmonica  and try to forget that sugar blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument  the songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional latin  mexicano perspective  but the overall sound is more like santana when carlos goes acoustic  the  hidden track  on the cd most overtly shows that the del castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the latin roots music  this is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys latin music or great guitar work of any style  but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out  the quality of music here really transcends the genre
__label__0 the frist time i saw this movie i hated it  however i saw it again  it still not that great but i own a copy  its good to watch ewhen i feel sick or am stuck in the house for some other reason  however the other two movies are much better
__label__1 the npbg type g lith pack had good picture life  but i d carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature
__label__1 thank you for showing me  i will use it as many times when it comes into my mailbox soon
__label__1 i discovered my ms office had a bug in it  and came that way from the factroy  i looked word over and it was clean  then the program itself  it does everything and well  and it does it without the tracking bug on it
__label__1 great movie  delivery of the order came in good time  this disc collector s edition comes with some interesting extras  i found the offtakes  blubbers to be in bad taste  but the rest of the extras were worth seeing  personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie  although it is interesting to watch  especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business  i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself  just my personal preference  no doubt others will have different opinions
__label__1 this was one of my first books to really read through  i fell in love with it at once and i could nt stop reading it  it is brilliant writing  you can easily imagine everything dahl writes as fact  i will always hold roald dahl in my heart as the person who set my reading heart on fire  and i have been an avid reader ever since  i still pull this book off the shelf and read it every couple of years  i am  and i still am enthralled with it  i now look for other books that he has written and still love his stuff  i will always be a fan  and you should be too  starting with this one  a great book  for all ages
__label__0 i was literally horrified when i first put this album in my cd player  this cd is absolutly terrible  every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play  furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent  they ll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing  do not  i repeat  do not purchase this album  i was expecting some cool  fun  funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious  the only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster
__label__0 bought this pack about  months ago  three computers at home  and worked ok  no viruses  then i did what i thought was a clean install of xp pro from xp home on one of the computers  and it carried over a lot of garbage from xp home i wanted to get rid of  but that s another issue  clean install   after installing xp pro  i was warned i did nt have virus protection and so i tried installing my nav again  you would think at some point nav would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a windows upgrade  and that the nav was legitimate  nope  fatal error and computer lockup  which i was able to survive  no contact opportunity at the symantec web site  i simply opted for microsoft s recommended antivirus software  computer associates  another twenty  then i had a heck of a time uninstalling nav  which would nt install and now would nt uninstall  what a waste of time and money  who creates these viruses  we certainly know who benefits from them  there is really nothing you can do  they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout  this little note means diddily  but thanks to amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something
__label__0 this scale is too small  i have size  feet and my feet dont fit on the scal
__label__0 i ve been using a win  version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the xp version was tempting  however  it does not work at all in my portuguese xp  after searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer s database i was informed that it does not work in nonenglish win xp  all the previous versions worked fine in my pcs but this one was totally disappointing  living in brazil  i had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value i would recover  shame on them
__label__0 hi  i have lost the cd rom to download the movie from the camera  sony does not offer it for free on its website  you have to pay  dollars to get it again  that clearly disappoints me
__label__0 first of all  i am a fan of madonna s music  not all of it  but a lot of it  as well as a huge abba fan  now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists  and apparently it is here as well  but why ca nt these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic  gimme gimme gimme  the abba song that is sampled here  is a fairly simple song to begin with  as many abba songs are  but the complicated arrangements  both vocally and instrumentally  are what made abba s songs interesting and fun to listen to  but taking a few bars of the original song  repeating it over and over and over  adding a dance beat  various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece  i think she would ve been better off either following a similar chord progression to gimme gimme gimme or just doing a cover  perhaps benny and bjrn should ve stuck to their strict  no sampling  rule here  for some reason many of today s dance  pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance  a good example of a radiofriendly dance  pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy s  so kylie  on their american  english album  the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what s going on  you ll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression   now i m not going to say  hung up  is a terrible song  because everyone has their own taste  but i m sorry to say it just does nt do anything for me
__label__0 this is the worst camera i ve ever owned  i m not exaggerating  i m so upset for wasting money on it  the only pictures that turn out  are outside in bright daylight  it takes horrible pictures in low light  there s a high level of noise in the photos  the video mode moves in and out on its own  ruining the video  i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos  my friend s  dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing  it just plain sucks
__label__1 holds all my lenses  camera body  remote  card reader  etc  with room to spare  compares to bags costing  times more
__label__1 i did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly  but it s a fantastic game  you get a building with your waiting room  exam room  living room  and bedroom  you build animal pens outside  buy medical equipment  buy books to learn about caring for each species  and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals  sleep  eat  and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed  care for  play with  and clean up after  it s a fun and well designed game
__label__0 i did nt see the other reviews until after my copy arrived  having now wasted a weekend reading this book  i have to agree with everyone  the topic sounds great  the book is nt
__label__0 i purchased the kaz ultra king size heating pad off ebay to replace another kaz heating pad that stopped working after  months  well  this is no different except i now have more expensive heating pad that is useless  just like the other reviewers  my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process  i plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time  i also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds  sometimes two or three at once  nothing worked  its was nice while it lasted  heated well without getting too hot  it is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months  thumbs down  do not purchase a kaz softheat heating pad if you value your money
__label__0 i agree fully with  quot  a music fanquot  above  this and david s self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work  i love most of talking heads music but do nt rate remain in light highly like most fans do

__label__1 this is a wonderful book  aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the alltoooften misunderstood postpartum depression symptoms  while i am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others  i urge brooke shields to reconsider a comment she made recently  she indicated that while she knows now that postpartum depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support  she does not believe that adhd exists nor that it requires the same level of support  it is essential that such public figures realize that what they have experienced is not the only form of reality  thousands suffer with adhd in ways that interfere with their livlihood  schooling  relationships and selfesteem issues  studies have shown this challenge to be as real and as debilitating as post partum depression  so please  brookedo nt deny the realities of other maladies  simply because you have nt experienced them  you of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others  your  voice  is heard loudly  your message must be correct  thank you
__label__1 we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dscp  which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism  naturally  only time will tell if this is any different  but in the meantime  here s what you need to know about this baby  the good    size and weight  fits almost comfortably in any pocket  much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i ve owned  thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere  the size is also pretty comfortable for onehand shooting    big lcd screen  you did nt need me to tell you this  right  makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying  though sometimes it does not appear very clear  especially if the subject is not static  however  it is bright and rich in color    infolithium  this is sony s name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left  only approximately  of course  if use is consistent  will provide you with a good idea  if you use one function then another then another  it tends to vary much more and is not as useful    integrated charger  usb station  a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the onboard battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer  minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger  though the bright white color is far from a match  the bad    focusing problems  the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it  i am not speaking about macros  but simply the function  or lack thereof  to focus on small  near objects  such as coins  stamps  or text  quick focus on objects farther away  though    integrated battery  i listed the infolithium as a positive  but the fact that you cannot just popin a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice  i do nt know if the battery is universal  but even if it is  it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement    incompatible memory sticks  i will not complain about sony s desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard  but this camera uses the memorystick duo  which is about    or so smaller than the  regular  memorystick  this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless  as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards    ineffective flash  the flash is tiny  thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark  within a few feet is okay  but farther subjects are not touched    x optical zoom  cmon  this is   x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera    slow write speed  there is a decent pause between pictures  meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate  you can certainly take pictures in bursts  but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick  previewing the images is also slow  this is also disappointing  as it s not faster than my older p   no tripod hookup  if you wish to use a tripod  you have to mount the camera on the plastic station  then connect the tripod to the plastic dock  this is far from ideal  well  there you have it  the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you  in which case this could be a great value for you  i am certainly happy with it  but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards  compatibilities  and dubious longterm quality
__label__0 this one is a product of bad quality  the cap of the batteries to a few days i damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear  product of bad quality i do not recommend it to him  you  them  and for quality the price must be low
__label__0 on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms cornwell  having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning  i simply cannot help but ask myselfis she really writing this stuff  very slow in the beginning  i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly  however  this novel does begin to pick up momentumbut not until the reader is halfway through  and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted  the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crimerichmond  virginia  where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl  so scarpetta with marino tagging along of course heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance  only to find that her old building is being demolishedand that the new one  under the leadership of dr joel marcus  is sloppy regarding policies and procedures  the demoralization of her former staff by dr marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta  and clearly he resents her intrusion  so why has he asked her to come  meanwhile  lucy  as head of the last precinct  is once again up to her ears in nonsense  for such a brilliant  successful young woman  as readers have always been lead to believe   why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life  in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee  worse than the weak storyline  and the fact that this novel is just all over the place  is the author s disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of africanamericans throughout  drug dealers are black  they re dead of gunshot wounds  and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man s  conspicuously large organ   are you kidding me  the trash collectors are  big dark men  and of course in an upscale neighborhood  the  old black woman  must work in one of the houses  the author s unbelievably narrowminded  stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best  and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy  read only if you must  but frankly there are better ways to spend your time  dy
__label__0 i wanted to like brotherhood  for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it  usually with a faint whiff of snobbery  or at least apathy   turns out they were right  brotherhood is half an album  most of its nine songs feel unfinished  as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their  smash lowlife and did nt care about the end result  brotherhood is a rush job  plain and simple  but there are still glimmers of hope within this barebones effort   as it is when it was  overcomes the album s overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic  and the melody is quite lovely   all day long   the emotional centerpiece of the album by default  is an intelligent  if halfhearted  protest against child abuse  while  angel dust  lacks a decent hook  its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest  and the tossoff  every little counts  has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order s work  the most popular song on brotherhood is  of course   bizarre love triangle   so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely   bizarre love triangle  is truly new order s masterpiece  the solid beat  slick sequencer work  and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best  catchy  danceable  and downright euphoric   imagine how well it would have fit on lowlife   sadly  the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable  the album s production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes  which has become new order s signature sound  but the songwriting does nt measure up  buy the album if you re a trainspotter  but casual new order fans would be better off picking up lowlife or  s power  corruption and lies  this one is just a footnote

__label__0 metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton  as this album is prime evidence of  he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here  also  newstead only gets one song on this album  which is ironically the best song on the album  in the history of metallica  this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial
__label__1 i ca nt wait to all the seasons of dallas are available
__label__0 american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree  i read the human stain a few years ago  and it was good  but  in pastoral  the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst  and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst  but absent the psychoanalyst  roth is our psychoanalyst  what he misses  however  is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control  the swede never failed as a father  rather  he failed because he could nt let go of his sense of responsibility for her
__label__1 my brother is cameron fry and it was nt until his first year in college that he found his ferris bueller  this is a classic that every high school student should see  it s a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best  it s easy to tell from this film that matthew broderick was destined to be a star
__label__1 following the series of firefly  serenity continues the story line for a few more steps  there are so many ways this movie is packed i cannot begin to properly mention them here  the storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a  solving the mystery  approach  the english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand  mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing  the animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality  the characters are complex  focused  solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations  the challenges the crew of serenity face are many  from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority  alliance  forces to the overt mortal threat of the  reavers   the climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue  the music in serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more  i suggest seeing the series firefly before watching the movie serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters
__label__1 bought this to help make muddy paw print clean up a little quicker  this works well  my better half thinks i have an obsession with mr swiffer    it does leave a haze on the floor though  i use the recommended  sec  cleaner dispensemaybe it s because i do nt change the pads ofter enough  overall  i would purchase the swiffer again if i had too

__label__1 how would you like to have to perform your own autopsy  that is the conundrum that faces dr maura isles in body double when she returns from a conference in france to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house  the investigation into the murder leads maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption  years before  and also leads maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women  this book moves quickly as maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion  it s a pleasure to see maura team up with dr jane rizzoli  maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of jane and jane seems to make maura a little less of an ice princess  this is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end
__label__1 a good product  to be surei ve used seventh generation s other laundry detergents and have been very pleased  this  review  is however a cautionary  while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans  loads  it is only rated for  loads  just a heads up  note  i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment  thus  this  review

__label__1 i received my emedia piano and keyboard method today and it s not a bad program by any means  however i have two gripes with the software  first  either the  full screen  option in preferences does nt work or emedia feels that x counts as a full screen  so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution  and what mac user does nt   you ll need to lower it in order to read the lessons  text  and since you most likely wo nt be sitting as close to your laptop  monitor during these lessons  this is kind of important  second  you need to have the program cd in your computer to get the sound and video to play  and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study  practice  there are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness  but it makes me mad that i need to resort to doing this  if emedia s so paranoid about theft of their product  why do nt they just stream the program s media portion from their website  at least it would nt be noisy that way  other than these two flaws  the program is excellent for selfstarters like me  plus it seems to be the only complete  lowcost piano  keyboard instruction software out there for mac osx  i would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the opticaldrive issue really bothered me

__label__1 great anniversary present  fav song  i love the way you love me  my husband loves to listen to it in the car
__label__0 a dismal disappointment  i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy  when i see the high ratings  i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product  the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done  a complete multifaceted joy  i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue  well it did nt and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings
__label__0 i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here  so i was upset when i watched this sad movie  gary graham  tv s alien nation  is a robot jox  which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought  the f  x are not very good and the story is paper thin  only the acting is good  but it ca nt save this one from being just a let down  skip it
__label__0 i first heard the song on the radio en route to work  i enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake  no doubt s redo of the  s hit brought back good memories of the new wave era  but  of course  it does not compare to the original talk talk version
__label__0 i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was  and finally got a chance to watch her video  i find her way overrated  she does have some funny stuff  she s got a particular knack for doing impressions  and there s some other genuinely funny material  however  the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience  she does a lot of vulgar material  homosexualoriented jokes  etc that are clearly just there for the  outlaw  value  and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she s personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base  it s just  not funny
__label__0 what could have been a hilarious  informative account of breaking outlandish oldfashioned laws and getting  or not getting  in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young british guys  i think the author is around   wryly making fun of america s perceived backwardness  sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and  when they could nt  they outright gave up on some great chances  the swedish girls in frisco  why include it if it did nt come to fruition and  furthermore  involved no lawbreaking    i m still wondering why they included their page tour of hearst castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log  cool  hearst had grecoroman statues in his poolroom   they do nt get arrested and they do nt really accomplish anything  too bad
__label__0 i loved my mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in  then a few days after christmas in  the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it  if i would tap the camera they would go away  but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working  it would turn on but then shut off  i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did nt work  it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out  so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use  so sad camera dea
__label__0 this thing stinks  so much digital noise its output is terrible  i do nt know how they can put this thing out and have it be so bad  do nt be fooled thinking wow  megs for a low price  i have a  meg sony that is many times better  all that noise blows the detail out  get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures  other wise stay away
__label__0 on the track   cleo s mood   it sounds like something that bookertand the mg s  along with the markey horns would ve cut  it sounds like steve cropper on the guitar  and booker tjones on the keyboardsthe sax style is definately jrit s a soothing piece
__label__0 this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series  the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny  usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along  the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it  what a waste
__label__1 and i knew it would nt be the last  very very fun  do nt think nancy drew is just for girls  guys can play and love the game as well  i am living proof of that  the game itself really is nt that hard  it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky  i do nt like puzzles  and that is the only  beef  i have with the game  and most mystery games  now  back to the game itself  intriguing storyline  suspicous characters and they all got something to hide  search for clues while interrogating suspects  explore the resort  run errands  break into locked rooms without getting caught  disable alarms  and snoop  and that is just the tip of the iceburg  if you like mystery games  nancy drew is for you  her games are nt overly hard  and they are very fun  even if you are nt a mystery fan  try it  you ll love it  try them all  you will become a nancy drew fan  trust me  i did
__label__0 we expose our babies  toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources  in several languages  therefore  having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one  given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment  our little ones are trilingual  english  spanish and asl  and they ignore us in all them    big mistake  the video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other baby einstein  be  items  in earlier be products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen  male hands were never present  this video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background  or at best  an elderly man briefly interacting with a child  everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing  caring or otherwise being nurturing to children  males are only seen  with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them  in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes  or at least distant  dry and quiet poses  such as talking with a much older  male  child  it is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape  however as movable and inane as potted plants  whom you can move and place at will  i felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities  asides  when you go into the spanish version  it is  for a professionally produced video  riddled with mistakes  three objects are mislabeled  in the first  when a cup  the plastic or paper tall type  not the coffee and saucer version  it is called  la taza   when in reality it should be  el vaso   as unlike english  where it is interchangeable  vaso  is the specific word for that item  the second  much worse instance  still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl  there  the clueless scripter translated it as  el bol   a clear and poor corruption of the english word into a one commonly used in spanglish  instead of calling it  tazon   as its correct name is  the last one i saw was in the yard  i m suprised they did nt call it la yarda    looka mami  get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas     this time they called an obvious swing  two ropes and a seat in between   la hamaca   when in reality hamaca means hammock  fortunately  we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls  but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages  in sum i was discusted with the whole thing

__label__0 while this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot  the mistakes are inexcusable  many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data  therefore  one begins to lose trust in the information presented  be careful if you use this book
__label__0 i purchased this program recently  and was very disappointed  the maps are very limitedfor example  most of the major tourist areas  beaches  newport  ect   in rhode island are cut out of the ri map  i recommend buying ms streets and trips   which includes pocket streets  in the box  instead  http    wwwamazoncom  exec  obidos  tg  detail    bdoeam  qid  sr  refpdbbs    vglancespcn with this program  you have the entire usa at your disposal  and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone  fortunatly  the store that sold me pocket streets allowed me to exchange it for streets and trips  after paying the difference   the prices are very close

__label__1 as a frequent reader of home design books and magazines  the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me  a quick review of the table of contents revealed that i had to have this book  pelosi begins with the basics  moves into specifics  and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune  the pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor  whether you are looking for a single design solution or  like me  enjoy reading about interior design  this is the book for youand it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home   interior divine  made my holiday shopping easier this year

__label__0 after really enjoying the amici forever album  i went shopping for another amici album and found this one  there really is no comparison between the two  i ve tried listening to it several times to see if i m missing something  but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe  i was very disappointed
__label__0 as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter  as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes  deficiencies in the book  and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about  for instance  the claim on page  that  cdata  is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong  his description of schema element declarations  pp    teaches that using globals  refs is the only way to define complex elements  and is inappropriate for his example  he makes no mention of globals at all  leaving the reader confused  i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information

__label__0 great features  right  i just returned it after very disappointing results  here are just a few issues   if you use a tripod  and you will need to   you ca nt plug in the ac adapter to save on the short battery life  because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the ac connection   battery life is very short   if you want to protect the lens  you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens   you ca nt take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter because the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures   the automatic settings are horrible  the auto focus  auto white balance  auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors   you cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording   quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light  save your money  buy a camera with better features  i am waiting for the panasonic hdcsd due in march
__label__1 the scene where eric idle whines  oh  you re no fun anymore   is a deceptive one  if anything  these guys are even more fun than before  the second half of monty python s flying circus s first season is even more polished and mad than the first  continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity  in these episodes  we have  a serialkiller barber  lecherous art critics  an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral  tunnel to java and jump the english channel  ken shabby  every girl s dad s nightmare  thuggish old ladies  bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla  camelspotting  and prime ministers falling through the earth s crust  the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border  soon  scotland will be choked with scotsmen   and england is pretty much abandoned  the culprits  tennisplaying  humandevouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda  and  of course  the stuff that has become comedy legend  the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store   it s a stiff  bereft of life  it rests in peace     and the lumberjack song   i cut down trees  i skip and jump  i like to press wild flowers  i put on women s clothing  and hang around in bars     of course  no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits  these five brits  and one american  who did the little cartoons  created some of the most unabashed  naughty  nasty  and just plain weird comedy ever  which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde  and all of this by men who often dress up as the world s most unattractive girls  with only a tiny budget and minimal cast  the s production values are omnipresent  and they are decidedly unpolitically correct  but in a weird way  these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise   the writing and acting are pure  raw  unrefined comedy  probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle  cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone  as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice  and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber  while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane  by this point  the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance  in other words  it s funny and should be watched
__label__1 i bought bhg deluxe  software to plan an addition  i talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing  i did not talk to imsi about floor plan d  i gave up after trying to get through to a human  i would bet a guess the software is as good as imsi s telephone skills  i talked to punch software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as i have integrated video on my computer  apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software  punch software s loss  not mine as that s a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product  chief architect offered a money back guarantee for their better homes and gardens products  even if purchased via vendors like amazon  i ll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software  even though it does have it s annoying quirks  even for a lesser package from the pro version  the library of items it very limited  i would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version  but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home  you learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space  even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item  since i am not interested in the d view  this is not a big issue for me  the item i needed most was floorplanning  d modeling is an extra item that i may play with  but is not essential for me personally  if you are truly interested in the d aspect  this is an issue  i would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice   for quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras  this software does better than ok  no experience necessary  and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly  i have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types  and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package  these are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more control of all aspects  since i will be laying out the floor plan  then turning it over to an architect with real softare  it s not a problem for me  i have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up  but by ignoring the autosaved drawings  i was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point  this software does have upgrade options to download from the company site  just like any good software company  they do provide spftware patches to download  i would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans  adding walls  doors  windows  and other items is very simple  just do nt plan on perfection  as it s based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches  not fractions  angles are an issue as well  if you need specific angles  this is not the package  it does preset increments only  i wish it had default preferences a user could select as well  being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redos  i hope the software companies read these reviews  there is alot of good information on how to improve the products
__label__1 the beauty of this charger is that it is   v compatable  so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage  i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each  very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability  lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors  if you plan on traveling internationally  this charger is a must
__label__1 this is a must have item for your kodak dig  camera  it allows for filters  tele  wide aux lenses or any mm screw on attachment  apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby  at any zoom or focal length  this adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens  if you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens  camera  from destruction  i always keep it on with a skylight filter  the skylight or a uv filter further protects the lens from impact  scratches and dust  if used when the lens is not fully extended ex  wide angle to normal zoom  the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade  kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture  but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories  do buy it
__label__0 this movie survives in my memory for over  years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made  i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies  they are either worse than this one  rare  or better than this one  as an example  buffalo   is worse  if you watch both in the same day  you will surely die
__label__1 why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer  while this os is not the top of the line today  it was when i bought it  if you buy the mac  it pays to have the best operating system  stay current  the hardest jump was from os  to os  i was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me  now it is seamless  like they say  just  plug n play
__label__1 i love the new digital canon  the only problem is it s not nearly as tough as it s film twin  i had the camera less than a month when the popup flash quit working  the canon people have been great  and very helpful  but i d rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory  the photos  however  are wonderful  film quality for the most part  printable and enlargable   it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the mm telephoto but i hike with it  so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos
__label__0 what a terrible upgrade  i m going to uninstall it and go back to  even though i specifically told it to leave my file associations alone  it changed every one of them  it s a nightmare  i m still trying to get nero disassociated with certain file types  to no avail  the backup program is awful  slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into  overall  ultra  is a much better product  i m going to uninstall  and send it back to nero with instructions on where they can associate it
__label__0 i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos  we promptly sent it back for a refund  i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor

__label__0 i have two   picture frames that are other brands  and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time  i got this one as a gift from a friend  and it is terrible   the instructions are difficult to understand  the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted  this is a weird size and i am not happy at all   i do nt recommend it
__label__1 i say the scale is pretty good and accurate but the fat  keep changing different  in the morning and night  like in the morning i got  and at night it say i got  i dont really trust the fat  but the pound is very accurate  for the price i would rather get something cheaper

__label__0 the eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable  but of course you can  buy  the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer  the whole thing was a waste of timei gave it to my five year old to trash  at least he will have some fun with it that wayit s realy just a childs toy
__label__0 i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking  it displays children as young as  years old smoking cigarettes  did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars   yes  the cigarettes and the smoke were real  not cg   i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script  because it displays a behavior that s not only illegal in several countries  but also threatening to both society and childhood  no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie  i give it a disgusting   and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children  to those that have nt yet watched this movie  please do nt watch it  unless you want cancer to win the health wars  and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker  if you want to depict smoking children  use computer graphics instead of the real thing
__label__1 rarely is there a book that i can not put down  this was an exception  quite a suspensfull page turner  any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that  i would have given it  stars  but i do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel  that s just my taste  by far  however  one of the best books i have read in a long time
__label__0 i bought two boxes of these luv diapers  thats  diapers   and i sure wish i had spent a little extra for pampers swaddlers  these diapers leak out the top because they do nt have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist  even the generic kroger diapers have elastic waistbands  i am just sad that i have to use these crappy diapers for so long  i also think they run small so i probably will not even use them all  what a waste  the only good thing about these diapers is the price  but  i would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue  ps i do nt like huggies either because they leak out the legs  hard to find a good diaper
__label__0 i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars  this movie is nothing but antigun propaganda  i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this  but it was like watching a train wrecki just had to stay for the end  you know  for those of you who do nt knowfirearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year  and mine was one of them  this movie cd might make a good coaster  but beyond that it is trash  some less than truthful  nra member   yeah right  wrote   i really liked and enjoyed this movie  the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention  it will keep yours too  just give it a chance  sure  it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry  but they deserve it and need to be more responsible  i may buy the dvd to watch it again  but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from amazoncom and not gotten around to watching  however  i may add this to my collection   horse hockey  member of the nra  more like member of the micheal moore fan club  this was the worst movie i have ever seen  they even had to lie to get you in the theater  as nothing was mentioned about it being antigun in the trailers  and saying that it was  a little bit slanted  is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie

__label__1 i purchased this camera as a replacement for canon optura  which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera  i decided to move on  after using dcrhc for several weeks  i believe this is a very neat package  overall  i am very satisfied with this camera  one of the first things that i noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of canon  i grew accustomed to adjusting optura s white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones  now i am finding  that automatic settings work just fine and  in fact  i did nt have a reason to play with presets as of yet  this camera is more of a  point and shoot  type than canon  it provides you with manual controls  but they are not easily accessible  still  i have not found a reason to mess with these  besides  for those  who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced  professional type of filming  i would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced  professional camera for under   this camera is also about half the size of canon and combined with low price and weight  produces a package that i can drag with me while going to the beach  bicycling  hiking  etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear  as was the case with my optura which  at the time when i bought it  cost me about  times of what i paid for sony  so far  i ve used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that i would expect to ever having to consider  i have no complaints about its performance  picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct  focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports  action  sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable  there seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording  all of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach  there are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera star rating  lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback  it would be nice to have these  as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it  still  among my friends  who actually have a camcorder  about  do nt own an accessory light or external microphone  so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features  it is not a criminal move on part of sony  the lcd display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if sony would provide it with more freedom of motion  it only swings out to  degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor

__label__1 did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the fm station sound about the same  maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars  the libertines are  or at least were  one of those diamonds in the rough  their raw  loud style is closer to punk than any other genre  but most of their songs are more welldeveloped than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans  make no mistake  though  this is a loud album  with the exception of the oddly balladish  radio america   it s a pretty steady sonic assault  and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between  louie louie  and live dylan on the intelligibility scale  what can be understood is more erudite than you d expect  though   what a waster  is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction   boys in the band  is the best groupie song i ve heard in a long time  and  the good old days  actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords  decipherable or not  most of the other songs are at least very catchy  the whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now
__label__1 the roller balls are excellent  the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well  the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow  it is abrasive to the skin  i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem  the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly  other than that  it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many

__label__0 though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology  it s the dryest  most aesthetically difficult to read textbook  especially if you happen to be studying the material online  through independent study  the publisher needs to redesign the book and  or you need to have a better online course professor  it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material  which is interesting in itself  if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction

__label__1 this book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers  former underachievers  and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child  having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself  i was compelled to write my own review  no one blames parents  especially dr rathvon they do the best they can with what they ve got  mental resources specifically  this book is for anyone who knows that their child is capable of so much more  it is never too late to fix  polish  and fine tune a learning mind  every student has the ability to achieve

__label__1 i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality  blamires had cs lewis as a tutor  and i ve read some of lewis s writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special  many people do find his works special of course   blamires  on the other hand  i find to be very unique  his book is top quality and very helpful  i m surprised this is nt a very popular book  as it ought to be  i have only two complaints  both of which are purely stylistic  first  the edition i have looks like it s a copy of an earlier edition  which makes the text hard to read  i got used to it after a while though   some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it  my second criticism is something that ca nt be avoided  the book was originally written in the early sixties  so a lot of the examples are dated  ie references to wwii  which was still in memory  also outofdate terms like  jive   etc   however  just a few of the examples are affected by this  the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work  since so much blamires s criticism of the christian mind  or lack thereof  still  sadly  applies  however  the christian mind today is being rediscovered  and the march of atheism is on the decline  with the march of religion in general on the rise  even though things are looking up  christians should keep blamires s book in mind  not to get too comfortable with this  secular  world  for our real home is beyond bodily death  that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book  superb book  and i really recommend this to anyone  this is definitely recommended for christians  and also for any nonchristian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today

__label__0 i really really really really like allison moorer  have been a fan since her first record  have roadtripped to see her numerous times  and love her songwriting and singing  that said    getting somewhere  is by far the least satisfying of her records  no memorable songs  overproduced  no  guts   as another reviewer said  when the allison moorer  doyle  butch  primm songwriting team called it quits  in more ways than one   their lennon  mccartneycaliber teamwork was lost  not that moorer sounds like the beatles  but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music  this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again  such a shame  i ve never had anything negative to say about allison in the  years i ve been a fan  but this cd left me cold  it hurts a bit to say this  but i cannot recommend this cd  the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the bstory line from an episode of  the larry sanders show   in that episode  sanders  head writer phil  played by wallace langham  finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy  as a result he lost his edge  when he was a miserable person he was an edgy  cynical  funny jokewriter  when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job  same with moorer  since her recent changes in her social life she has started  singing a sweeter tune  in her life  but it came with a cost  she does nt seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that  other  songwriter who was so good   a little edgy  sad  sometimes bitter  or at least that s how i interpreted it  granted  that was nt her entire oeuvre  but it is what made her songs special for me  now she s happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur
__label__1 actually  comic book creator lets you use your content in a million different ways  including reselling of your work  the only limitation is that you ca nt sell comics created around branded content like images from marvel  paramount  tokyopop  etc because they do nt allow that  it s all in the user agreement  check it out
__label__1 it is really good enough for my need  i have no problems so far
__label__1 it is really great    sure  it does hurt  but not any more than waxing  i do not shave because i get cut very easily  this is a great alternative to expensive waxing  even when i have more hair it works  i would buy this product again  and again
__label__1 i thought the first ice age was great  this one is good  not great  they really used scrat better this time than before  but the rest of the characters werenot undeveloped  but it just did nt have as many hilarious situations  sid is as hilarious as ever  but manny and diego doe nt do as much  its a good  fun movie  but its not as good as the first one  rent it though  it does have some hilarious scenes
__label__1 i bought this item last month from amazoncom for  i thought it is using some kind of handlike massage motors  and not those vibration motors  when the item arrived and i setup  i found out they are using the vibration motors  a little disappointed i am  but i use it  it is not bad if you do nt mind the vibration motors  the heat feature is great  however  the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position is nt holding well  the leatherlike material really feels like a lether  the vibration really vibrates the whole floor  so i suggest to put on carpetted areas only  i personally like the handlike massage chair better  but this  chair is worth the price  others would sell for over
__label__0 after reading a couple of other reviews about the  quot  qualityquot  of transfer on this dvd  i decided i wanted this in my collection  what i thought would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality  i was very dissapointedthe quality of transfer of the picture is horrible    a great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality  non anamorphic  deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered  picture tones are very  very bad  along with what little color that is desplayed  almost a black  amp  white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on  even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv  it still was so dark it almost was nt worth continue watchingthe only things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and  quot  suppossedlyquot  in dolby digital ex  the beginning dolby intoduction was deffinatly in dolby and had good sound but the movie itself did nt distributeand dolby sounds that i could make out on my theatre sound system  sounded like mono to methsi dvd reproduction stinks and i suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this  quot  goodtimes videoquot  version untill it is put on dvd correctly  why they botherd is beyond me  because i wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen  i am taping it on to vhs for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow  i suppsoe i ll have to be content that i got the widscreen version on vhs for now untill they rerelease it on dvd with better quality  or they show it on tv in widescreen which i highly doubt  heck  even taping it off tv you d get a better picture quality than this dvd

__label__0 alrightown up  which idiots are responsible for the release of this  musicals  collection  since when have  pinky  and  island in the sun  been musicals      these two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar interracial relationships theme  would someone please tell them that  just because harry belafonte sings the title song over the credits  this does not make  island in the sun  a musical  i suppose in their book  because shirley bassey sings the title song over the credits  this makes  goldfinger  a musical too   it makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing  it seems to be a case of  oh  just grab six movies off that shelf and lump them together    if they do nt know which are the best titles to release in a certain set  why do nt they ask someone who does know
__label__0 compared to argento  i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated  he might be a pioneer  but as a stylist he is sadly lacking  his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry  even if you like horror films  argento fans seeking out  shock  on the strength of daria nicolodi s starring role  music by two members of goblin  under the nomdeplume  alibra  and srgento s supposed gialliobased debt to bava should buy  shock  with caution  although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out  it is still a fairly dreary  dull  repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances  finally  the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco s rubbish  and that s saying something   my dvd of the silly  she killed in ecstasy   filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better  shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this
__label__1 purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday  reason  my computer was moving much slower than it used to  mcafee scans my computer everyday  and does nt find anything  yet it was fully updated  i had a feeling it was nt working  when i installed this thing  i scanned it right away  this is what it found  viruses   spyware   adware   after the scan  everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again  i am very pleased with panda s software and will purchase again if needed
__label__0 col mike martin  raised in iraq  speaks fluent arabic  the taliban are pashtoon  they are not arabs  they do nt speak arabic  they do nt even like arabs very much  they are a totaly closed tribal society  i spent a year living and working with the pashtoon in  in helmand province  there are no members of the taliban who are not pashtoon  the other ethnic groups in afghanistan  the tajik and the hazara  are opposed to the taliban  mike martin would not have the correct family  clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off  sorry  but forsythe has dropped the ball on this one
__label__0 the reviewer who called this a disney  bait  switch  hit the nail right on the head  i  too  remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid  then later on disney channel  and was awaiting these to be released on dvd  as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both  but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together  third rate offering  i never cared for the elfego baca story  i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played  but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the  swamp fox  episodes  above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative  and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war  who  with his compatriots  probably contributed as much as george washington  thomas jefferson  or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom  i really loved this story just for itself  not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set  i have even gone as far as removing it from my  wish list  to save the funds of my family and friends  as well  i shall wait to see  hopefully  if disney will ever release the entire  swamp fox  story in a complete set  for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price
__label__0 ok folks  this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company  the art of shaving products in general are really nice  albeit a tad pricey  this small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together  the full sized items will cost you about    total  the included brush is a  toss away  quality brush  this is not just my opinion  but a quote from the manager at an art of shaving store  my advice is to get some samples from a department store  then purchase the art of shaving shave cream  wow  a great product  here on amazon  plus either the tweezerman badger brush for  or a best badger brush from crabtree  evelyn for

__label__1 this handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills  it is easy to set up  just put in the  of hours between your doses   or  hours for twice a day or once a day medications  i use two of these  the timer counts down the hours and then chirps  when you silence the alarm  it automatically starts the countdown again  the storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when i travel  most of the time  i just use it to remind me to take my pills  i wish i knew about this a long time ago
__label__1 i bought this straightner at walmart for about the same price found on amazon and i really like it  i bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does  i wanted a chi  but i could nt pass this one up for the price  i  ve only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well  a good product for the price
__label__1 such a thoughtful gift  a real treat for those of us living in colder climates  especially in the winter  the warm lotion is truly a treat to dry  itchy winter skin  anyone would love this
__label__0 the problem with this film is i read the book  i was disappointed simply because  be cool  is an obvious showcase for the musical talent  the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example  somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would ve been more intersing if somebody would ve said   hey  do nt forget the book   but being true to the original source is not hollywood s strong suit   be cool  provides some popular music  some known faces  but without john travolta  the movie would never have been made  a few laughs are provided  a couple ironic scenes show up  but there s too little to sustain a fulllength feature  basically  the project is a disservice to everyone involved  some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon  is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a clichï½  the rock does the best he can but again   he s a gay bodyguard   he s the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji  his boss vince vaughn  who  in the book  is far more sinister but in the film he s an idiot  of course chili is chili  travolta does a very nice job  and chili s obviously the smartest guy in the room  uma thruman s performance is  well  not funny not serious  not intense not much  at best  she made me shrug  i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr  but there s just not enough  and all the negatives reflect completely on the director  enough said there  my advice  watch  get shortyagain  or read  be cool
__label__0 this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep  but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep  i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep  so i purchased this book and disregarded the other  comments  although  they were right about the obscurity  this book still taught me alot  you do nt necessarily need it  but if you want to be prepared  this book will not hurt your bank account that much  i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature   stars  check out the reviews   and the internet  that is all you need
__label__1 despite the chintzy  unconvincing facial hair  jeff daniels  being the exception   martin sheen s toogentlemanly interpretation of gen  lee s accent  and his beard   obvious  saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war  generalized  and largely inaccurate  interpretations of the underlying history of the war  and hopelessly  ridiculously  wildly offthemark attempts atnew england accents  the film still works  i understand that to get a film produced and distributed  it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast  but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice  and c  thomas howell s performance well  let s just say that his gluedon beard was more convincing than his acting  jeff daniels  however  does an excellent job  in large part because he does nt try to convince you he s from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers  using every stereotype associated with nasal  r dropping  instead of focusing on the socalled nasality of the ne accent  think of sheen in the missiles of octobah   daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief  but then  here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner are nt the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production  i think the story works because there s enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable  the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle  but the movie makers either did nt have the budget for gore  maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards  or decided to err on the side of forbearance  if gettysburg had been made  years later  it might have benefited from the newer style of violencedepiction  as in saving private ryan  thin red line  or gladiator  it falls a bit short of that  however  finally  it should be noted that the producers  director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war s historical underpinnings  opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves  anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood  very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery  they fought to preserve the union  which is a very different concept  abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south s hand  but it was not the sole cause of the war  the movie dumbs this down a bit  making the message more like what you d find in a thgrade text book  the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal  but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war  the north absolutely needed to win it  but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost  years after gettysburg  c  thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie  still and all  the film is very watchable  and due credit should be given to the reenactors  arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film
__label__1 what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips
__label__1 two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith  there are so many good tracks on this set that it s hard to pick out some over the others  a couple of superb standouts are jolson s  swanee  and  rockabye   although every track is just excellent  the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great  i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby
__label__0 i agree that this is technically an excellent film  but it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind  given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with richard widmark s character  his enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism  but in the end he does nt just lose  he is literally thrown away as garbage  and then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take  all in all  i was left with the question  what is the point  the commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well  its basicly a description of what you re watching  while you re watching it  i see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so i ll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie
__label__0 every lakers fan i ve ever met lives in the past sadly now  to them  the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes and we know why magic had to leave their basketball knowledge from the s to the s is rewarding  after this  however  they do nt have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization  the lakers have been a good team over the decades as apparent on this dvd set  but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus  the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl  but now they re just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers  i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center  and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands  i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson s mantra  i told you so   further illustrating how things have changed in la  jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow  so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem  than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly  there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor  chamberlain  west days  i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past  so laker fans  keep living in the past if you so desire  maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again  long live the forum or the staple remover center or whatever they are calling the lakers home now
__label__0 wow  this movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time  i watched it last night and i woke up in a bad mood  everything about it sucked except for the nudity  hence the single star   i understand it was supposed to be something of a  comedy   but without a touch of reality  i found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it  the acting is awful  the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke  michael caine s goofy appearance was accentuated with some ginormous glasses  there is nt a teen girl alive who would find that  sexy   when i saw the  blame it on rio  reviews on this site  i felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than  stars  many gave it      strangle them  then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor
__label__1 okay  after reading several reviews  i decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs  boy did i get my moneys worth  it was so incredibly bad that i was first cringing in horror before i started laughing  the characters  especially hiei  were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing  now  i m a die hard yyh fan  but i give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch  put me in a good mood for the rest of the day  if you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i d definitely suggest buying for th he of it
__label__1 for the first time in several versions microsoft has changed the file format  however  it is for the better  the new files are all compressed using the zip compression format so files are much smaller  old files are  times larger than new files   the new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification  ie linux geeks can open office documents   the new interface is radically different  do not install this if you have a large project to complete  the interface is so different you will not complete on time  however  after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it
__label__1 hr block  works well like it always has  i ve used and liked hr since the turbotax activation debacle  to the extent that i can like doing income tax  what is great is the media the software comes on  install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere  maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday  with piles of used drives in a box  but for now it s a super handy way to store and move a few files   megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive  no matter the price it right

__label__0 i d give this product zero stars if i could  i use the quickbooks online payment service with version   and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version  with that online service  so they forced me to upgrade  so i bought the upgrade  and when i ran the installer it would nt accept my serial number  i spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to india  and he still could nt get it to work  i finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer  i had heard from others  including an accountant  that this version was bad but could nt believe it would really be this bad  i d used qb since the earlys and never really had a problem  but this is really  really bad  intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version  it s a total lemon
__label__1 compared to fp  and earlier versions  it offered some major improvements  even letting one code in  gasp  php with live preview  it is highly configurable  and easily tied into sharepoint  well  i think that was the intent   it was quite an evolution  moving beyond fp  with some fairly advanced features  while still retaining the  entry level  small business learnable  functionality  albeit cookie cutter designs  of previous versions  i was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with frontpage  an odd change  knowing ms   but also offered other code functions  some on par with dreamweaver  but do not mistake this for dreamweaver  even the first mx version  it s still aimed at microsoft only  you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else  eg  php  cold fusion   but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions  mostly good  some horribly bad  the good  being able to tweak it to dozens of standards  compliance  sec    xmlish stuff  whatever  by default these things are not set up  so it does take some learning  what annoyed  and freaked me out  was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with access  to create database driven sites  the database had to remain in a public folder  ok  i suppose if you re using it only on an intranet  i believe the point was to code with access  then mod it slightly to interact with sql server  but most folks probaby did not use it that way  knowing the history and  fire and forget  ease of use of frontpage  anyhow  i d call this a paraprofessional version  it has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of frontpage  ever  it is also going byebye  there will not be a frontpage   due to the switch to expression web  which retains some fp functionality  but the  friendly  and pesky  bots  are gone   no more email bots  whatever bots  gotta learn how to roll your own

__label__1 i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought  and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me  i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym  nothing could have been more appropriate  it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint  it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments  each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bitesized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter  i could nt be more pleased with this intro to philosophy

__label__0 i bought this album because i loved the title song  it s such a great song  how bad can the rest of the album be  right  well  the rest of the songs are just filler and are nt worth the money i paid for this  it s either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe  kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene  he s gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town  i ll get down off my soapbox now  but country music really needs to get back to it s roots and stop this pop nonsense  what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things

__label__0 there is no doubt that antonia fraser s  the journey  is written in the author s usual wry  witty and highly engaging style  although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as  lugubrious    there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marieantoinette s shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people  the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable  however  i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions  for one thing  why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage  what about sophie of anhaltzerbst  catherine the great  who was also a young stranger in a foreign land  this sort of thing happened all the time  it was what being a princess was all about  i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi s impotence  phimosis and surgery and all that  she simplistically portrays him as being asexual  which was not true  because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed  it   but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion  i must say  it is a first  fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof  while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character  i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character  but i guess fraser does  oh  well  it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography  i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy  if the queen had had her way  her descendant would be reigning today  and that is just the reality of it  for a better study of marie antoinette s relationship with her husband  i would recommend vincent cronin s  louis and antoinette   as for better biographies of the queen  let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english
__label__1 for ina claire ninotchka was a last chance to show posterity what she could do  for there would nt be many film opportunities offered her  she d been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years  and her elegant beauty  very much a highbred dina merrill type look  was still aglow  she was one of carl van vechten s favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her  staring imperiously against a wall of baize  or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair  she suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at mgm  when her part in i take this woman was taken away from her and given to the cheaper verree teasdale  her director  josef von sternberg was also let go  and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it i retake this woman  the  woman  in question was hedy lamarr  after ina claire s hilarious showdowns with garbo in ninotchka  the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of lamarr s central european rival  a year or so later  and edmund goulding put her to work as dorothy mcguire s mother in the charming  underrated claudia  but that is definitely a mother part and as such  put an end to ina claire s film career  as the countess  swana  she gets lots of billy wilder s best lines and laughs  she s not afraid of anyone  much less garbo  much has been written about the chemistry between garbo and melvyn douglas  indeed a delightful mix  but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without swana s steely  icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations  in real life ina claire lived on to a great old age  she was  when the last curtain fell for her  and here in san francisco  where she spent most of her life  all the lights in her building went off for an hour  precisely at   while her fans stood on the street  devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the dakota hotel when john lennon died

__label__1 i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you re facing in your own relationships are commonplace  they re not dysfunctional  every family has its share of issues and you do nt need to feel overly guilty for yours  the book s underlying theme is that families that honesty  consideration  character  belief and perhaps above everything else  resilience  can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it s probably  though not always  worth the effort  stories include  resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up  the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife  the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead  and the effect on kids   dealing with the families of your inlaws and family objection to marriage  how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you  dealing with the death of a child  how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing  etc although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations  actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life  with all it s frustrations and headaches  and balance it with everything  if you have any relationship  friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration  resignation about then i strongly recommend this book  it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time  it could change your relationships and your life
__label__0 you can breeze through this book in under an hour   i just did  while it makes for a suspenseful  albeit entertaining  account of what happened that infamous night  damore relies too heavily on witnesses  accounts and police remarks  often little more than kennedy bashing   by now  most of us can accept the facts  that emk drank way too much and drove off a bridge  subsequently leading to tragedy  dui accidents happen every day  chillingly often to average people  the fact that this happened to one of the greatest senators in the history of the united states only reaffirms this

__label__1 ladies in lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today  this is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character  beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful ladies  judi dench and maggie smith  take on those roles  this movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection  the movie takes place in a small cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation  perhaps isolation from life  from emotions and from vulnerabilities  the sisters ursula and janet widdington  played by dench and smith  spend a quiet  uninvolved existence  venturing out rarely  but on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm  a bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate  this one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions  feelings that have been hidden for so many years  it is the ability of dench and smith to portray these emotions  these feelings  for the camera that make this movie sing  and the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by daniel bruhl and natascha mcelhone  together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening s entertainment

__label__0 gerd ludemann writes   historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the deadwe must acknowledgea worldwide historical hoax       a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support  three streams of thought permeate  the resurrection of christ   gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish  invent  or explain away  peter and paul experienced hallucination and  vision  experiences proceeding from selfdeception  belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific  each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions  or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counterchristian polemic  in his chapter  translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection   ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles  purpose and tradition reworked   re  gospel writers   and  historical elements   in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic  or perhaps  he intimates  to cover up some element of embarrassment  for example  ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council  which condemned jesus   but that mark  earliest gospel   likely  invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus  but ludemann needs to discredit such notions  for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb  ludemann s case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances  ludemann gets carried away with himself when he  in tabloid fashion  suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to  disinfect a traditionof a dishonorable burial  of jesus  this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze  ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew  mark and luke of being antijewish   refer to the ridiculous appendix    is christianity a  history of self deception   ludemann invests in the rather highrisk prospect of hallucination  for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament  that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid  ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence   corinthians  is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus  multiple appearances  even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text  vs   to the early  s ad  the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection  three physical events  also  the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination  as well as being hugged  ludemann though  convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above  and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions  introduces hallucination  what accounts for these hallucinations   peter s vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning      paul s  event had a character of light and  like the vision of john  happened in the spirit  ie  in ecstasy      but paul does not report  i was in the spirit  as john does  see revelation    john is deliberately conveying a nonphysical experience  paul is not  when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual  in the spirit  experience  he does so in terms appropriate to that experience   corinthians    so we have record of paul s ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual  ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages  modern depth psychology  to explain paul s conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to  apostleinchief of a new program of salvation      so  we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul s subconscious state  than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death  burial  empty tomb and appearances  ludemann s examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural  historians look for the best explanation of the evidence  yet ludemann writes   who decides at what point of historical study a  theological explanation  ought to begin      this is rife with misunderstanding  one need only confirm that an event occurred in history  regardless of theological implications  also  simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism  thus supernaturalism  is an entirely logical proposition  yet ludemann quotes another author   the disciples believed in phantoms   imagined that they were surrounded by miracles   took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time       this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus  disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened  and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works  even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle  ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection  we should abandon christianity  sadly  he reaches the wrong conclusion  self deluded by a proliferation of  one can imagine    seems to indicate    likely enough   and  one thus suspects  reasoning  ludemann boasts  accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision       may the reader decide otherwise

__label__1 i think this is the best book that i have ever read  i thought that the civil war was very  very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong  the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more  from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye  each character has a different story of the war and of life  i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war  it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn  this book was excellent from the first page i read  even though this novel is very brilliant  some people might not like it  if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character  like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz  he had the funniest voice i ever heard  when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging  but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself  and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book  the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too  trust me  before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really  really new to me  i had to get use to it a little but since it was nt very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman  some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife  another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion  another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy  i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story  in the story he sounds like he s from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes  and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with  shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses  that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses  but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and does nt talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces  that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart
__label__1 i will state first off that i m one of those hipster snobs who dismiss pearl jam s debut album   ten   as the whining chartwhoring pseudoanthemizing overpricedflannelflying watereddowngrungifying crowdsurferpandering piffle that it is  if you think that makes me inherently biased  unbalanced   this review probably wo nt be  helpful  to you  and you can move on the other  or so reviews  if you decide to hear me out  i promise to be fair   cause even though i may be a hipster snob  i ca nt deny to myself the sweet rockin  going on in  vitalogy   this album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called  underground  or indie rock and the  classic  rock mainstream  thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it does nt sound sloppy  ballads like  better man  and its companion piece  nothingman  are clearly influenced by neil young and even  nebraska  era springsteen they re sincere  emotional but not mushy  sentimental   not for you   with it s lyrics about how eddie vedder s small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes  is a nonetoosubtle complaint about pearl jam s status as  millions served  rock gods and a longing for the more strippeddown aesthetic of punk  that  of course  is more directly the point of  spin the black circle   an oldfashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to sstera husker du  for vedder  the joys of vinyl are that they seem  warmer   a symbol of  tradional values  in a rock  n  roll sense  independence  hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny  sterile corporate plastic of compact discs  never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture  vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a   record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves  pearl jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference  on the other hand  the big corporate evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience  which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of  vitalogy   it s designed as a salute  satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical  mental  spiritual hygeine  the album  therefore  aims to strike a balance between the fondlyremembered rock stars of the band s own youth  the who  neil young  and the more recent indiepunks that resparked their interest in the power of rock  fugazi  sonic youth   hence the title  the album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like  bugs  and  hey foxymophandlemama that s me   even though they re intended to give the album a looser and more lighthearted feel  still  some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like  last exit  and the somewhat proggy sea chanty  tremor christ   whose title i dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement   even though it s uneven   vitalogy  is the work of a selfreliant  even ornery band that s in full control of their ideas even the bad ones  it s also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottomfeeding whores like stone temple pilots and matchbox

__label__0 one thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings  this is my own experience and this may be the last year i use taxcut because of it  first of all  it would not allow me to efile my state return but did nt explain why  i later discovered that for most states you apparently ca nt efile a partial year return  then when printing out the state return it told me i had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program  i later found out that taxcut does not support all state tax forms  i then had to get that form and fill it in manually  and then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains  and there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had  taxcut also advised me i could save  off my fed bill by contributing to an ira  so i opened and ira and contributed  when i went back to taxcut and entered the details it told me i was nt eligible for any tax deduction  i was ready to be tied up  this software is seriously dysfunctional  i m guessing by this stage you get the idea  bottom line  i will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year  oh  by the way  if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option  you can get a credit from hr by calling taxcut option

__label__1 i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it  stars  but after watching it again  i realized i liked it better  i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you   i do not consider all of the performances goth  martiya possesion are more tribal than anything  at least on this video  and i really dislike the expression  or lack thereof  on their faces while they are dancing  they either look completely bored  pissed off  or smug  i skip right over it  i also did not care for asharah s dance to the drum solo by solace   opaque    the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all  the music is saying  fast  big  upbeat  and she s standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves  and of course  we all love the sm pieceexcuse me  sm is not part of the goth subculture  and has no place on a bellydance video  jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer  but she did nt dance much on this and i did nt want to see what was on her part  another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music  i like solace and all  but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre  there were a few  but not enough for my liking  my favorites on this video were tempest  ariellah  jeniviva and ayshe  for wierdness factor   for all of its faults  this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose
__label__0 this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doinghis book is mostly lifestoriesand stupid ones at thatsome teeter the line of racism  he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil  fat black woman  and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book  i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on  race   and besides that  his  or  spells and such are old and tiredand there is no  selfinitiation  for the type of voodoo he s talking about  i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money  i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing  if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help  his title is also misleading because  voodoo  ussually refers to hoodoo and  vodun  ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either onehe s just running his mouth on and on and on as if his lifeexperiences are even worth tellin  this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn background to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so muchthis was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about
__label__1 it s good as my title says  however  i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off
__label__1 fast  gentle  light  hair dryer  no frizz  quick drying results  the diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air  the dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job  the motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use  do nt waste your money on the expensive ones
__label__0 i think this product is highly overated and this claim of being  accurate is false  once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with  accuracy  but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when you realise that the very next sentence is complete gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted what you have in that manner  i think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an american accent may get good results while a person with a british or an australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training  in summary i think the program is unreliable with an accuracy of  at its present level of developement  it has plenty of potential and with future developement it could much more reliable but at its present level of developement i think the performance is mediocre
__label__0 the transfer is real real bad  the story is also weird but its o
__label__1 bought  of these  years ago on qvc for my husband and myself  i was pregnant with my second son and going to get waxed at the nail shop  where it smelled like nail polish remover  was just too much for me at the time  we love these shavers and they work just as well today as they did  years ago  i m not sure what the other reviewer is talking about  i get an incredibly close shave with this  to be honest  and maybe a little too personal  i have nt waxed my upper lip since  i only use this  there is no stubble  no pain and great results  i have dark hair  and if this in anyway made me look like i shaved  i would never use it  i am buying  more for back up  i hope they never stop making these
__label__0 pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in  hold on  let me start again  pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting  dang it  give me a few minutes here  pinnacle studio can assist   samuel l jacksonstyled expletive   how many times is this gonna happen  start and stop  start and stop  enough already  one more time  now  what was i saying  oh  yeah  pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video  if you can keep it up and running  got the idea  just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the pinnacle products  this is a bargainpriced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heartpounding races to meet project deadlines despite the software malfunctions  after installing the program  installing the patches  uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches  i am still experiencing too many crashes  if you intend to use this program to piece together a video of uncle morty s birthday party  the family vacation or your neighbor s kid s bar mitzvah  the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness  if  however  your video projects fit under the category of  job description   then i suggest spending the money for adobe premiere
__label__0 this album is so boring in most places  i do nt know where keith sweat s head was at  it does nt keep your attention on the second half  keep it comin  was okay  but the other songs keith produced as well as joe public were lousy  he was smart to include there you go from new jack city  but the songs before and after it are so bland  it seemed like the formula that worked for keith sweat s first two albums did nt work here  i fell to sleep while hearing the album s second half how can anyone create such dull songs on here  sweat s trademark whining just does not blend with these songs  if he had wanted to  he would have given these songs to usher instead of singing them himself they d be better under him  usher   but i warn you  do nt get this album it s going to let you down
__label__1 i have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it  the auto shut off is annoying when i forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise  very pleased  just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it does nt  rattle  like the old fashioned ones  great improvment and larger size
__label__0 i bought this  installed it  patched it  and then started going through the rather incomplete and disorganized documentation  the examples i played around with all worked fine  i started writing my own program  a simple math game with basic sprites and speech  i wrote a simple speech and graphics routine  which mostly worked  i wanted to try to figure out why one of my functions was going into an infinite loop and so i started the debug mode  so i could watch what the variables were doing  very simple  basic  and common programming practice   blat  debug mode crashes  debug mode works on much simpler programs and for the few examples i tried out  but on my  line routine it generates exceptions  after the crash  i opened my project and found that everything i had written in my source had been reverted to an old version  i know for a fact that it was saved many times since then  but for some reason it decided to recall an old version for loading  as if all my saves after an arbitrary point never happened  if i ca nt run debug mode on my programs or save my sources  then what s the point of this software  complete and total buggy garbage
__label__1 ahh this is a great cd  i listen to it every day  it s fun music  and the lyrics are wonderful  hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do
__label__0 the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst  josh hartnett  kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline  this film is directed by sofia coppola  lost in translation   i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself  you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does nt mean you belong in the same category as best director of alltime  sometimes magic does not stirke twice  how can all five sisters end up killing themselves  their homelife was nt that unbearable  a lot of parents are religious  but that does nt mean you ll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide  kristen dunst just gets on my nerves  her acting is the same in every film  do nt believe the hype  the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking  poetic film
__label__1 the passion of the christ  songs  is a fine collection of great songs  each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that mel gibson has created  the standouts are the song  i see love  by steven curtis chapman  third day an mercyme  scott stapp s powerful solo debut song  relearn love    rainy day  by big dismal  and the emotional  new again  by brad paisley and sarah evans  despite a couple of songs that do nt reach their true potential   the passion   and  how many lashes    this is a fine cd that belongs in anyone s and everyone s christian music collection  grade  a
__label__1 product arrived as expected  i ve had the tooth brush for about a year now and i love it  one complain i have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty  it cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach  i have not tried soaking it in oxyclean  that might work even better
__label__0 it s a gimmick  looks good on tv  does nt do what it says  i m embarassed to admit i even tried it
__label__0 i really love to get these for my wife  surprises are best when i give them to her  and she enjoys all of them from this great author  but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series     having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds  really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great  just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others  get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up  peace everyone    jeff
__label__0 the light was very good  the magnifier  very tiny  made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses  but the worst part were the tweezers in themselves  they were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle  also  i am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair  these did not  so they do not tweeze well at all  was nt worth all the bother of a return  i just threw it away  it was a good idea for a product  just poorly made
__label__0 the product performs inconsistently  it failed miserably when it tried ocr on a page printed in comic sans  for instance  mistaking a s for g s  and  s for a s  etc in short it was worthless for scanning in something as simple as a list of names and email addresses  it s  ok  when doing some fonts  and generally manages to figure out where the images are  the interface is supposed to be simple  but is counterintuitive  and confusing to learn  scanners are  iffy    may work  may not  so make sure you test in the  day trial period  support  forget unless you want to pay  not even a single support call is included in the package  i will not buy or upgrade with this company again unless they are willing to provide at least a minimum of a couple of support calls or emails  i ve had almost all the versions before this  and to be honest like this one less than what was before  if you want to try it  buy from a source that will honor the day moneyback trial period  you may need it
__label__0 have tried about six times to install it  i ve followed all of the online troubleshooting advice  all to no avail  it says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings  it tells you to check the log  well  there are over k entries and even if i found the errors i do nt see any way to correct the errors  when i try to run it i get  starter mfc application has encountered a problem and needs to close   i ll be returning this puppy to amazon for a replacement
__label__1 sigmund freud has done an amazing research in the field of dreams and their meanings  you will be amazed how every single detail in the dream has a meaning  according to sigmund freud  not that i agree with him   and it is very impressive  personally i enjoyed this book very much
__label__0 note that in my previous review  in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer  i was only referring to the  quot  that touch of minkquot  dvd  the father goose dvd is not that bad
__label__1 i am teaching myself japanese  i want to learn more languages  i learned german  french  and korean  i want to learn korean  because i have a friend who speaks korean  this software is very awesome    this can really help students who are taking french or spanish to get a good review  if you find a language you want to learn from this software  good luck with your studies and have fun
__label__0 it s unfortunate that with a name like canon  you expect a quality camera  that s why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind  unfortunately  this is not the case  i bought this camera to use in graduate school  industrial design   i needed it to do research for my thesis  i figured between that  all the product photographs  and the need good portfolio pieces  spending the  on an mp camera would be well worth the investment  i was wrong  about a month after i bought the camera  it started to malfunction  the lens got stuck and would not come out  neither would it go all the way back in  so the lens cover would not close  not only putting the lens in danger  but draining the battery as well   it was still under warranty  so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village  illinois  it was received  and i was informed that my camera would be returned in  business days  that was almost a month and a half ago  i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it  every time i call the service center  i am told that the  parts are on back order   evidently they do nt know when these shipments are due in their center  so they do nt know when i will have my camera back  the best part is  when i called two weeks ago  they offered me a  brand new  s the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because  they never do that   meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair   i pointed out that the s was only mp  had a smaller screen  and cost nearly  less than my camera  i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in  today i was told that there was no information on my camera  the backordered parts  or when they could send my camera back  the woman on the phone asked me why i did nt accept the s that was offered  and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine  she said they were not authorized to do that  i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters  and she suddenly had a technician she could consult  and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week  i wo nt hold my breath  but a copy of this review will be sent to canon
__label__1 i find this product  easy to implement  train users  and monitor  manage any small business
__label__1 hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like lady sovereign  she is not only lyrically impressive  but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving  which is basically what she sets out to do  i dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the uk  but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now  and i will patiently await for sov debut us album  favorite track  though all of it is really good  will have to be  the battle  feature other grime scene artists like shystie  zuz rock  and frost p spitting the wildest  barely understandable lol  rhymes ive heard  no men and women have battled against each other like this  especially for the listening public  how ever  no one should compare sov to anyone  missy or mia  all emcees  particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such  sov has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date  it s refreashing to see a new spin on hiphop
__label__1 i run two websites using this program  easy learning curve  i recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple  workable program  ignore the crittics  this is a nice programonly wish in batch editing i could do multiple web page saves
__label__0 this was the worst thing i ve ever heard  except maybe clap your hands say yeah  my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever
__label__0 be advised  this software is for a single user  only licensed for one computer  i bought this for home use after using ss for  years and vcom said it would no longer be supported of    i installed it on  home computers  it worked fine for  weeks  then it popped up a box on my second computer that i couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer  i needed to buy additional license for each computer  when i tried to use it on my main computer  it popped up the same message  so now it will not work on either computer  i uninstalled it and sent it back  just because it s cheap does not mean it s any good
__label__1 compared to the olive  aloe bar  this one seems to lather better
__label__1 i bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it  definitely a good buy
__label__0 the author gives vague advice  the  calm down    be objective  cliche advice  if you do nt believe me  i m literally quoting him  although the author tries to make his book seem original  as you can read  it s not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances  but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned  this is not something revolutionary  this is rehash  save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation  you do nt need to read hundreds of pages to do it  or spend  on what to imagine
__label__1 set the diffusion to  stun  when you do nt want your flash to  kill  with harsh  sharp  shadowy edges  yes  you need this if you have an sb why  nikon does nt make a diffuser for that model  basically  it fits snugly on the tip of the flash  slides off and on easy  will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks  like that macro shot of the benihana chefs  here s what it does  diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments  simple  sherlock  the omnibounce  what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic  performs as expected  no real cons  except shipping adds almost  to the price  so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering
__label__0 this is definitely not a bad collection  but there are so many better ones out there  that this should not be your first choice  the song sweet emotion has been completely destroyed on this album  the entire bass intro has been cut out  and the song starts about an entire minute into it  there really is no reason to do this  as even on the radio  they play the entire thing  as it runs about  and a half minutes long  the song starts at a terrible place too  it sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song  then just stuck it on the cd that way  again  not a terrible compilation  but definitely not a good first choice
__label__1 i have been looking for a particular song for several years  this album had it
__label__0 i wanted to like this book  but i had to give up in the end  if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough  the execution of detail is nt   kosinski ca nt write  he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important  whereas the reader is always expected to discover  depth  in simplicity  nothing to be recommended for
__label__0 these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them  which misleads one to think they are good quality  i bought them for my son  and by the time i got around to sending them  i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in  so the lens was misaligned  it was past the day return date  so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use  they are still not right  but i keep them in my car for occasional use  my advice   spend some extra money and get a good pair
__label__0 even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback  and it weighs about the same  all the bottles are realy tiny  they look like a one time use products  the once you receive for free with your purchase  and the brush quality is not what i expected from this company  if you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it
__label__0 i love the history channel  have infinite respect for the avg  love john wayne films  and lived two years in the part of china where flying tigers is set  so  you d think i might adore this film  i had hoped so  but unfortunately republic pictures made this opus on the cheap  john wayne plays a fictional commander of the american volunteer group  somewhere between claire chennault and pappy boygnton  he does his best to carry the film  and does ok  but he ca nt carry it alone  bad effects  cheap stock footage  flimsy sets  and bad script all plague tigers  republic made little effort to hide the california filming location and even used the wrong planes  there is little mention of the ossavg connection  and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the avg  even if it were accurate  the heroes of the avg deserve better than tigers  this film is nt a tribute to them  it s a sloppy  propaganda film that does them little service
__label__1 i ve had this book since  and i still refer to it for ideas  it has such a unique and diverse pictorial on each page by  grand  and  credible  photographers  for anyone who takes pictureslikes picturesthis book is a must get for you  i have it on my coffee table and i get rave comments on it all of the time about what a great book it is
__label__0 it s to bad i ca nt give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them  this program is total garbage  a gargantuan waste of both time and money  seemingly with every menu change  it recatalogues your entire photo collection  on all drives  which takes hours  like   to accomplish  and  while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer  do nt even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it s subfolders  ai nt a gonna happen  but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you  but  of course  after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing  it does nt display the contents  no  that would be way to logical  after realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl  i checked the memory usage and found that the corel photo album  deluxe was using  to  times higher than any other program running  and that includes norton internet security  a notorious memory hog  guess we now know what the deluxe part is  as far as i am concerned  corel photo album  deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the  best of  anything  it is a creeping  bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money
__label__0 ordered this item on sept  they were supposed to ship it within  week  after  week i received an email  they said they needed  more weeks  another email today  nov    they think they can deliver it by november  that s  months after i placed my order  at this point  i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year  fortunately with amazon  they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order  which is what i am going to do right now
__label__1 yes  the beatles by which i m not comparing supergrass to them  no  supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles  but other british rocknroll greats like the kinks  david bowie  the zombies and many others  but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present s  this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rocknroll of the  s and  s  and without doubt represent the bohemiaintellectualhard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circasgt  pepper  an intoxicating and highly addictive album   recommended for anyone any age
__label__0 i like machine head a lot  many people disliked  the burning red  and called them sellouts  but i appreciated the effort to make something different  then came  supercharger   i have listened to it a dozen times  looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it  it never came  this is a bad cd by a great band
__label__1 i was very young to really appreciate the ins and outs of this band and the members between sammy  roth and evh  i honestly can consider myself a newbie to this timetested rockers  i just downloaded this off of itunes and i can tell u folks  every track is amazing  its like when lars  metallica  said once   i was always amazed with gr  if i may borrow this line  i had always heard of the great evh vs hagar vs roth but honestly never appreciated this guitar work before today  evh is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists  my brother in law was debating with us about slash  sammy  evh  and edge  u   clapton and apparently they all chose evh  i did nt believe it till i heard it  evh is an inspiration  anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in evh s history  should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds evh has been to and in
__label__1 the enclosure has a solid feel to it  i dove with it three times with no problem at all  it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra  the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit  so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure
__label__1 i was able to use the canon ef x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming  i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open  the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all  you could see the hairs on the animals heads  it s fantastic
__label__0 i had a waterpik which started having problems after a year  planned obsolescence  la waterwho knows   i bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing  i like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small  just my opinion  humble as it may be
__label__1 i really wanted a ccd model  but since i m just starting out and need to buy other stuff  like a tripod  monopod  media  firewire adapter card  camera bag  etc this fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere  yes the usb connection does work  yes firewire does work  although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version i was using  not the fault of the camera
__label__0 i love mr koontz and have long read his novelswatchers  intensity  odd thomas and so on but this was dissappointing  not to mention just plain depressing  and come on with the corny slapstick banter between the characters  okay okay  we know the  year  old leilani has a high iq but really  she speaks like a  yearold rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence  these characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into  therefore  i put it down after  pages of this twattle  koontz has done much better in the past  lastly  let s keep dogs out of your next few novels  please  it s getting a bit old  how about a smart cat or raven for your next novel  maybe mixed with some more downtoearth folks that speak like real people do
__label__1 yes  the kit is easy to use  but if you do nt bleed freely  get a few extra lancets before you start  most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free  the kit only comes with two  which can be used only one time   it took me  jabs to get enough blood for the test  i had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets  because i m too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool   other than that  no complaints  the lab got the results back to me faster than expected
__label__1 collin has done it again  i did nt think i d enjoy a cd as much as his  quot  the walls came down   quot  but  quot  tracksquot  is just great  every song is better than the last  you ca nt go wrong with collin raye and you ca nt find anyone with a better voice  buy this one
__label__1 i have been using computers since dos  and this is by far the most user friendly  comprehensive  and powerful operating system i have used so far  aside from linux  if you are interested in an easy to use  dynamic os go with xp professional  it has lots of features that are always coming in handy  unless you wanna go crazy and are an it power user  in which case linux   go with this os  its great
__label__1 i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well  i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years  the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a rundown community is a classic of american literature  what this book and oconnor s other novel  the last hurrah  apart is the writing  in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man  oconnor wrote very well and his language is beautiful  from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all
__label__1 i have tried nearly all brands of energy bars  hooah  are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
__label__1 started out a bit slow and built into a real action packed thriller  several times i found myself saying   oh yuk   nevertheless the story line was fabulously interesting and you ll fall in love especially with thomas  a down syndrome young man with a special gift  this is another great story by koontz
__label__0 update       the vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the        time frame  and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below    picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results  appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished  but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the lcd display mars the effect somewhat  at  inches  this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close  the images are smaller than a x print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand  i found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away  on an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better  the size of the lcd also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular  true of any frame in this category  my biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware       it will only display up to about  pictures  i expected that what ever was on the memory card i inserted would be displayed  overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos  i am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer s product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it
__label__0 i ca nt beleive this guy s arrogance to try and rerecord songs that are essentially and always will be sinatra s domain  any idiot will tell you that once sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him  fact  ask tony bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you  sinatra is the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better  not only does he murder  a very good year  but also attempts  badly   mr  bojangles  even attempting to ape sammy davis s mannerisms  i had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a  a joke or b  a blantant attempt by williams to crossover to boarder appeal  now i see it actually meant it  robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please do nt attempt the rodgers and hart songbook  though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs  your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover ca nt cover up your mediocrity  the only time i d like to see you swing is from a lamppost  stick with  songs for swinging loverscome fly with me  to hear the real thing  an insult to classic songs
__label__0 the batteries that come with this charger we re not a problem for me  in fact  i was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine  i was however  disappointed in the charger  the charger requires that all four aa batteries be in the charger for it to work  you cannot charge just one  two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted  also  there are a maximum of two slots for aaa batteries and when they are in use none of the other aa slots are usable  given the price of nimh batteries  the charger works out to be about  which is about what it s worth at best
__label__0 i bought  of their cd s from amazon after hearing the song  bad days  in a batman movie  this cd is the worst of the  i bought  not one good song  totally lame  i m not even going to stick someone else with it  i m just going to throw it out
__label__1 i am a former general nutrition center employee and there are hundreds of  powdered  protein products that  hype  about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out  if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick  bloated or passing gas  then you need to trust in optimum nutritions  whey protein  it truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes  i strongly recommend  milk over water for even better taste  but water will still do the trick  if you buy vanilla  i suggest mixing it with berries  bananas  strawberries  or bananas for added taste  this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money
__label__1 when i bought this i played it on repeat for about  hours  different versions than on the album  i think it s their demo   this version of modern age is amazing  definitely worth buying
__label__0 i purchase this press  and was totally disappointed with this product  it takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press  than with an iron  i will be returning
__label__0 yes  it s easy to install  configure and use  the footprint is small and it does nt hog resources  that s the good news  the bad news is that this software s virus detection rate is abysmal and the company s tech support is worse  so  in short  do nt trust it  two examples  starting with tech support  after building a new computer  i had several blue screens  stop errors  bsods  and my analysis seemed to indicate that ez antivirus was at least partially responsible  i emailed support with all the relevant info  their  paraphrased  reply   we understand that you are having faults in windows  this is because you have windows installed  if you did not have windows you would not have faults  thank you for contacting etrust   i should have that engraved on a plaque  example   av detection  when my subscription ran out  i uninstalled ez and tried a demo of kaspersky  it found  viruses on my computer that ez never told me about  in this case  it s  strikes and you re out  goodby  computer associates
__label__0 okay  so i m not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers  but i can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible  first off  it is built to integrate with outlook  but does nt really  it always leaves one email in your outbox  the one you posted first   if you open your outbox before they send  then the one you posted most recently wo nt send either  seriously  the only way i have been dealing with this is that i have left a dead email in the box permanently  if i need to change something that has been posted to the outbox  i have to open it  then get out of the outbox  change it  and repost it  otherwise it wo nt send   ever  i have set nis so that it does nt scan my outgoing email  as it blocks anything over mb  and in my business  i send things that big all the time  in a recent update  however  it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing email whether it is set to or not  i spent hours and hours on the phone with  supposed  technicians  who refused to answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network  what that has to do with this program  i do nt know  i tried the  live internet chat  function  but   and i kid you not   it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy  when i complained  he hung up on me  gotta love that  when i tell nis that something it has categorised as spam  is nt spam   it does nt remember the sender s email address  like it is supposed to  it just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it  regarding spyware  i have another piece of antispyware software called webroot spy sweeper  that routinely finds spyware on my computer that nis did nt catch  this has just been one headache after another  their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful  with not one actual solution to any of these problems  the only piece of software i have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is winfax   another norton product  i will never  ever buy another piece of norton  symantec software again as long as i live  they should be ashamed of themselves
__label__1 this is an essential collection for every al pacino fan  in carlitos way and scarface he does one of his best work ever  then there is the performance that gave him his only oscar so far in a scent of a woman  if you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the al pacino collection
__label__1 you can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk  though it takes some patience to get things really smooth  i ve used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems  my skin was a little sensitive after the first time  but no terrible pain or anything  and there s none at all now that i m accustomed to using it  it is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving  but if you read the instructions first you should be fine  a couple of very minor drawbacks  it s rather noisy  more so than a regular electric razor  and if you use the comb attachments  it s tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time  but that pops right back in  so not a big dea
__label__0 im not from usa  my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working   it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country  i lost  us
__label__0 i really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is  not  the motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working  you wait about  minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again  but by the time you are getting results in one area of your foot  the thing heats up and stops working again  i went through four intervals of effective operation  heat buildup causing it to quit  waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again  finally i decided it is nt worth the time and aggravation  even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked  one more thing   when i gave up and decided to return it  i took my duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot  i worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hotrunning motor  i ve never seen batteries get scalding hot like this  update  found something much better after returninng the artemis  i tried the medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance  this one costs  times the price of the artemis but is soooo much better it is well worth it  the medicool is plugin electric and has much more power than the battery operated artemis  it has variable speeds   different sapphire filing attachments  and enough power to operate as long as you need  the sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime  whereas the artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries  so over time the costs of owning the artemis will add up   if the overly hot motor does not burn out  if you have serious callouses and corns  like i do  the medicool pedisenso will do a very serious  rewarding job  i m so glad i found it and i am grateful for the relief it provides

__label__1 i deal in major brand cameras and panasonic cameras are my personal favorite  i ve seen people whine about the  noise  they make many times but have never found it to be a problem  i own the fz and the fx for my personal cameras  the fx is a very fast camera and takes great pics  i love the mm wide lens  compared to most cameras i ve used the fx does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images  i love panasonic s solid build and reliability  they may not be as popular as canon or sony but in my opinion are every bit as good
__label__1 a surprisingly tiny book   the picture in the upperleft corner is nearly actual size   after receiving it  i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page  it says  x  x  i had not noticed that before i ordered it  the book seems much smaller than that  not that that is a problem  it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box  i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you ll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever  it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading  for one thing  the pages are much too small for emergency tp use  not that i am complaining  mind you  this is a gem of a book with over  interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from  the amish  to  zero    this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text  but who cares  the book is fun   each page has its stated  fact  and a followup paragraph to expound on the subject  also  there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three  instant personalities  each  little tidbits of info about famous people   although  thomas jefferson got his own page  as did alfred hitchcock   and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently  bla bla   the information here is actually correct  will and mangesh research their topics  not just publish unprovable  facts  gathered from the internet  use the contents with confidence
__label__0 i purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature  the positive reviews here are from first impressions  however  i have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then  hours use  when i first received it  it felt very light and cheaply made  i gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best  last time it worked  the motor slowed down to almost a halt  i keep it cleaned and oiled  the motor is just too cheap  im not sure what the company wahl was thinking when they made this product  they should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image  i would not even attempt to use my warranty because it s not defected parts  it s a total lemon  it would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund  i would even pay the difference  i do not recommend this product
__label__0 i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel s the stranger at the same time  after listening to the stranger  my mouth dropped  billy s voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction  then i put in boston and could nt tell a difference from the cd version i already own  i think it s one of the best albums  but if you already own it on cd  do nt bother upgrading  there s nothing special about the sacd version
__label__1 i drive alot commuting to and from my job  this music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely indiana fall  i m sure i ll recall those colorful images as i continue to listen to this cd through the colorless days of winter
__label__1 this album is awesome     my favorites are pure and appreciate
__label__0 this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy  here s why   the objective is too small  only  mm   inches  so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe  i suppose it is adequate for the moon  but that is it  the planets will appear as very small disks  one will be able to see saturn s rings  but the image will be very small  forget it for deep sky objects  clusters  galaxies  etc  the mount is an altazimuth  which will not follow the celestial object in the sky  the earth is rotating  and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision  a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects   the mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope  the observer will find it hard to look through  very small eye opening   and will in most cases cause blurred images  the  mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece  the barlow is a x  which again is too poweerful for this scope   the mount will vibrate when touched  which will cause the image in the eyepiece to  shiver   which is very frustrating  even for the low price  do nt be enticed by this scope  it has too many flaws  save your money for a larger scope with a better mount  jim  konedog  koenig  astronomy buf
__label__1 this cd is the funniest cd i own  the first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny  the second half is a little hard to understand  and it louds like is was recorded poorly  that is why i gave it four stars  track  is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is  mins of pure comedy  eddie makes fun of stevie wonder and boxer larry holmes  and he does it well
__label__0 this is the only album i own of joe strummer minus the clash  i ca nt say it s very good  i hate having to compare it with it with his work with the clash but it s inevitable  his lyrics are nt as great  edgy or provocative  there is nt any fantastic music either  i am not really sure what to say since i have nt listened to the album in so long because it was so bad  i truly tried my hardest to like it  but i feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake  believe me  i absolutely love everything about the clash  the lyrics  joe s voice  the music  the attitude and how cool they were  this is not joe at his best  it s cool though cause now he s gone  go buy some bob marley albums instead  joe would not have minded
__label__0 the scale part works fine  but the fat  measurement does not work  if you care about fat  i d recommend using the hand held device instead  it gives more accurate reads
__label__1 i purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully  i also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office  gym and around the world  they are easy to pack and are lightweight
__label__1 this program does what it says  it does limit you to only  loadings of the product on your computer  so if you have more than  computers you have to buy another program
__label__1 the panasonic pvgs was discontinued in late  in anticipation of panasonic s new  models which will be available in the spring  the pvgs is compact  delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above  has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring prosumer videographer  it lacks an audio output jack  which many will fault it for  it does have a separate microphone jack  the menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use  it is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact  uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that  lowlight performance is poor  but there is an accessory shoe  so you can mount an auxillary light  i would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings  parties and other group events  battery life is about what you would expect  so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended  all in all  a very nice ccd camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easytouse package  jerr
__label__1 i had a very old version of hallmark studio  do nt even remember how old  wanted to update  i installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features  lots of cards to choose from  very very pretty colors  the event planner is great too  the only thing i would change is the ability change font in the planner  and move written info by tabbing  otherwise it s a wonderful program  highly recommended   satisfie

__label__1 this photo editing software package is unreal  it has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at  right out of the box i began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results  beats any other software in it s price range  i have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive  two things  do nt even bother with the free version of snapfire  which is included  it is redundant with pro photo and rather simplistic without much value  it is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with corel by way of an upgraded version  and unfortunately the software is not well behaved and crashes to frequently  if it were not for this stability issue i would have given it a    star rating  corel  nice job but get it working better
__label__0 i have bought this product and i have gained lbs  it didnt worked on me  i guess you just have to try the product  i just ordered hoodoba  on amazon and hoping that will work  hoodoba has good ratings
__label__0 these diapers are the most awfulest things i think i ever bought for my baby  i received a lot of the  swaddler  size for my baby shower and i tried to use them for about  weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth  stopped using them and lo and behold  diaper rash gone  fast forward  months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied  figuring that my son was older  maybe they would nt do as much harm  wrong  the rash came back with a vengeance  i had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay  i think it s because they are lightly scented with green dye inside  definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin
__label__0 i have had this camera since jan   and have so far taken approximately    shots while on trips and at weddings  do nt expect much from it and you will be happy  as an entry level dslr it does what it s supposed to do in ideal conditions  i find it s strength is in taking people photographs in bright light  provided that they are not moving  cons  in landscape photography this camera is lacking  both due to inadequate megapixels and it s inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well  battery dies fast  the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting  especially when shooting in raw mode  i have yet to fill up a gig card when shooting in raw mode  approx  shots  before the battery dies  surprisingly when shooting jpegs  i get more shots per charge  over   but hardly enough to last a day  i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike  so i always carry a backup film camera  my trusty elan    the viewfinder is very dim  when i look through my elan  and then through the d  it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the d s viewfinder  in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap  especially when having to resort to manual focus  autofocus in low light for the d is terrible  when shooting indoors  the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject  i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur  this is despite having a ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus  the ex flash is supposed to  talk  to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed  however  with the d  this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over  under exposed  after about five months  the shutter button started sticking  i would click it and then it would remain depressed  the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little  another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button  and since there is only one thumbwheel  it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed  for example  if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature  then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel  when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera  this is a real annoyance  so would i recommend this camera  if you are a casual point and shoot person  it s an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos  but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately  look elsewhere
__label__0 after using this product for mac for over  years  i m done  the price keeps going up  the  taxhelp  within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost nonexistent  the server meltdown this year was the last straw  their servers were nt too busy to let me pay to efile  but  apparently they were  surprised  by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service  baloney  i ll use a pencil and paper next year before i give intuit another
__label__1 overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems    it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a sd card and into memory and vice versa  this would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer    hooking it up to a computer is a pain  instructions are not helpful  if you are using the viewer to look at images off of sd cards in remote places  ie trailcamera  it works fine  but i d like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so i can leave the card with the trailcamera   this is nasty  if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can  crash  the viewer  upon resetting it  it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card  powering off  swapping cards wont help it read  the pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract  reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader  for what i use it for i like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around
__label__0 never shipped  i ordered this before christmas  they said it was in stock  where is it
__label__1 i have been using mcafee products for the last  years  i did not have any problems with viruses  but it is true  i try to stay out of dubious web sites  i purchase my mcafee software from amazon every year because of their rebates and every time i see    star ratings  it is unfair  their products are excellent  i have installed mcafee internet security suite  on two computers so far  the first one is a dell laptop  i unistalled the previous  edition and adaware  since adaware and the  ed are incompatible  and the installation was perfect  not the least problem  i ran into problems though with my desktop  i have tried to remove the  edition and i could not find a remove button in windows  add  remove progrmas  i poped the  ed in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically  after the instalation the firewall did not work  i noticed that somehow the old  ed was still there  i went to mcafee s web site and i got a removal utility that got rid of all mcafee products on my computer  another great tool i used off of their web site was  virtual technician  which told me that the entire installation was messed up  however  after cleaning up with the other utility i did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly  it took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem  yet i love to play with computers  mcafee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions  i continue to trust mcafee s products  i love the cleaning utility  it is very thorough  i plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites  it cleans all of your internet traces  it takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed  yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange  i hope that the  edition will have the anonymizer built in  it would be a great tool  in the end  protection is what it matters  and mcafee virus scan and personal firewall have done it for me for the last  years
__label__0 i suggest watching the original version  sword of doom  which is amazing  a lot less acid is involved  and less cliche  izo is a rent  at best
__label__1 after  years  the camera s original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge  this replacement battery arrived promptly  fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours  i wish i had replaced the battery sooner  instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power
__label__0 denzel washington is probably my favorite actor  even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate  he shone  tom hanks  well  lemme quit hating the guy  this is a wellintentioned movie  tom did a creditable job  and we had extreme closeups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached  i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy  a passionate one  though  since he s still a latino  after all  actually  this is a hollywood  message movie   and you know what that means  it s about as subtle as michael moore  those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours  those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie  those who do nt agree with the message  stay as far away from it as possible  there s a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy  the way they stared at him reminded me of  lao wei in china  experiences  denzel s character was reminded of segregation  even though he s too young to remember it  and started to care about tom hanks  character  aids discrimination is bad  actually  any discrimination at all is bad  and that s the movie s message  i agree with the message  but still  that s all we ve got  as a totally irrelevant nonsequiter  if the name  sam francisco  means anything to you  you ve seen subtle commentary on discrimination  i love a great courtroom drama  this one was merely good  with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a twohour film  they had to take a few shortcuts here  sad  ai nt it  but even so  a wellintentioned film that i m glad i saw  once  not twice  once is enough  thank you
__label__1 it s just packed with all kinds of goodies  i highly reccomend it
__label__1 i really enjoyed this book  i found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly  i am a theory student  now  so i wanted to see a lot more math  but aside from that shortcoming  which some might welcome  it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level
__label__0 this is about other people talking about richard pryor with a fe clips of pryor

__label__1 after purchasing many dog training manuals and finding them not quite up to snuff  i was very pleased to finally find a book which was comprehensive and authoritative  it breaks each area of the sport down and is easy to follow  the book is intelligently written
__label__1 i loved this album  strangely enough i was introduced to the title song by gray s anatomy where i just had to find out who was singing that lead  alice russell   the rest of the album is like the r b music i grew up with  definitely worth a listen
__label__0 the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella  too bad those are nt basinger s legs though  nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger  i have never understood ackroyd s characters  and keeping in form  he is once again as unfunny as mud  basinger tries so hard  too hard  to rescue this film  but that s no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film  ok so she munches on batteries  and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime  she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts  jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script  however  his contribution seems way overstated to me  he does nt have much to do  funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her stepmother is not like other people  basinger s character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do  think  jarjar blinks  i suppose it s ok as a backdrop for housecleaning  but that s it  flat and mechanical
__label__1 i am a lover of  greatest hits  compact discs but this one by far is the best one i have purchased recently  this compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that joe walsh made and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock
__label__0 i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington  i liked that shaver  so when i found the r at sears on sale for   i decided to replace my old topsellingbrand rotary shaver  big mistake  after  months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck  especially with drier winter skin   not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r while trying to shave around the mouth  i am going back to my old shaver  how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave  but it does
__label__1 this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eyesore even in small rooms  also  stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers  would give it  stars but you do have to refil it about every  hours  which i guess it s good that it s easy to refil  the price is also the reason for  stars instead of  i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price  perhaps you pay for the convient size  overall  i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size
__label__1 i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it  rather than having to use one or the other
__label__1 this camera is simply amazing  i started out with a canon g  and then a canon g  and then a canon d  and now this canon d mark ii n  i debated and researched for  months between the ds mark ii  d  and d  my decision was primarily narrowed down to the d and this d mark ii n  yes  i wish this camera was a fullframe and also shared the  mp like the d  but you know what  it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i m  glad that i did  for me  this camera is definitely the one to get because the  point focusing   fps  and the d pro body  interface  menu  layout  etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor  trust me  if you do nt know how seriously fast the  fps really is  you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide  because of this fps alone  i m actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my d  and with a d at fps  i just said forget itno way  i m not even a professional taking pictures for a living  this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a d to this camera is out of this world  with the phenomenal auto focusing  additional metering  it s like i m now playing with a bentley  with the d mk n  coming from a mercedes c hatchback  the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it s a mercedes name and they do nt want to spend any more money on a real mercedes   this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro  also  i do nt shoot action pictures all the time  and i do love portrait photography  and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures  but even with the  crop factor  there is still a huge improved difference going from a  crop and you wo nt have vignetting problems with some lenses that you ll have on a d  with this d mk n  you can still take wonderful wedding photography  landscapes  etc as much as i d like to have mp like the d  mp is really all that we need these days unless you re going to blow up and print photos that are larger than x s or around there  unless you re printing extremely large posters and whatnot  you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the d can  the resolution and mp is definitely enough  plus  it s also invaluable to know that you have the  fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to  the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive  are the weather seals  probuild high quality construction body  easy to use and navigate menu system  you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times  dual memory card capability  you can shoot on  memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use  separate cards independently  builtin battery grip  you do nt have to shell out extra for this   longer battery life than the other cameras  best customization and most options that you can set to your liking  more than the d or the d or d  i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it  otherwise  the d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money  and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long  or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments  and do nt want the fast and most accurate focusing system that s great for ai servo

__label__0 first off  i d like it better if we had   star options  judas unchained really does nt deserve a   more a    or    i have a love  hate relationship with peter hamilton s books  he s very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a fasterthanlight society plausible but  as with a lot of these hardscience  libertarian sf authors  he badly needs an editor  i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel  pandora s star  he also has far too many  main characters  who  despite  pages  never seem to come alive  they all speak with essentially the same voice  and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped  s era hippies   come on  does anyone seriously say  dude  in the real world much less the imagined future of the th century  and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young  or rejuvenated  women  hamilton s treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best  on the one hand  the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed  represented and believable  on the other hand  the dynamics of the relationship between  old timers  and  first lifers  is unsatisfactory  in four centuries  for example  no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty  perhaps the commonwealth s continual expansion is the safety valve but even here  the government  controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties  controls it  another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life did nt change   i mean the characters of a novel  almost by definition  are dynamic  goget  em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die  why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime  the aliens are ok  the problem with them  and this is true of nearly every sf story  is that they tend to be one dimensional   they re all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up   this is a problem in fantasy stories  too   on the plus side  i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien  deus ex machina   ozzie s adventures in  wonderland   ie  the silfen paths  do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge does nt really help anyone defeat the primes  overall  if you started with pandora s star  you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained  if you have nt started down this  silfen path   i recommend alistair reynolds  tony daniel or iain banks  they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date

__label__1 in all the talk about education issues these days  it s easy to forget that what s really important is the relationship  the energy  between students and teacher  when the teacher closes his door and is facetoface with thirty kids that s where it s at  it s not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum it s what happens between people in a classroom  this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager  active kids and a caring  active teacher  it s not all pleasant  and successes are sometimes small  but a pervasive caring underlies it all  as a teacher  this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork  go for a walk  go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day

__label__1 noah webster s book is fascinating reading for today s students and teachers alike  as well as for the average citizen  as there is much to learn from it  while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text  it certainly has a place in every school library  one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used  with diacritical marks  accents  applied to all relevant vowels and consonants  words are divided according to syllables and stress  it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet  something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching  the terminology of traditional grammar is used  and there are copious word lists  with words grouped according to common factors  i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects  nowarchaismsthy  thou   foreign words and phrases  abbreviations explained  punctuation  etc   this book should remain a spelling classic

__label__1 in  and   jim henson s the storyteller aired and became an instant showpiece for television  a truimphant  but shortlived  series breathing fresh life into nine lesserknown northern european fairy tales and  later  into four timeless stories drawn from greek mythology  these old folk and fairy tales  mined from countries such as germany and russia and compiled in  discs here  along with the greek tales  are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers  john hurt for the european fables and michael gambon for the greek retellings  but  with much respect to mr gambon  who himself does a fine job  it is john hurt who decidedly draws my attention  hurt  with the more eyecatching portrayal  is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes  it does nt hurt that the stories featuring hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by anthony minghella  who  nearly a decade later  would win an oscar for directing the english patient  as such  jim henson s the storyteller gloriously lives up to its titular billing  john hurt s performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as  propelled by his captivating voice and effectively offkilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy makeup  he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories  minghella s screenplays are replete with rich  witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up  the kids  of course  wo nt have that frame of reference  but  still  watching these episodes  it really does feel as if you re sitting around the fire  enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns  michael gambon  on the other hand  is burdened with the weightier and grimmer greek tales  thus  he eschews john hurt s light  ebullient touch  opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona  he s pretty good  mind you  but  in the final analysis  he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to john hurt  both hurt and gambon  by the way  are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog  as operated by brian henson   at a half hour per episode  jim henson s the storyteller is presented in a marriage of live acting  creative animatronics  and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery  jim henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values  coming up with excellent special effects  for its time   seamless puppetry  matte paintings  and yeoman makeup work  all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting  a charming quirk of the series  which adds a nice touch  is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the storyteller and his dog  the camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace  but  somewhere in the background  whether it s on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup  images depicting the story are set in motion  pretty neat  the stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid s fable we re used to over here  especially the greek entries  and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones   the soldier and death    the heartless giant    but do nt keep the kids from watching this series  everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories  it does help that most of these tales are little known in the states  thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there  when was the last time cinderella or beauty and the beast  timeless as they are  offer up anything new  this is just about as perfect as television shows can get  the only flaw i can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever  all the episodes are superb  but if i had to pick the best of the pack  i would definitely go with  hans my hedgehog    the soldier and death  and  the three ravens   with several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series  jim henson s the storyteller  the definitive collection truly is a must have dvd set   spoilers follow  the nine european fables   hans my hedgehog   from an early german folk tale  a barren peasant woman  desperately craving a child  naively says aloud that if she had a baby  she would nt care what it looks like  soon enough  she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog  much to the father s dismay and the scorn of the villagers   fearnot   from an early german folk tale  a carefree  absentminded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear  though still very good  this may be the weakest episode of the lot  gabrielle anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role   a story short   from an early celtic folk tale  the storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and  as punishment meted out by the king  must tell one story a day for a year  all goes well until the very last day when the storyteller suffers from storyteller s block  brenda blethyn has a part   the luck child   from an early russian folk tale  seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king  the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him  but those blessed with luck cannot be undoneand the same could be said for prophecies  the soldier  death   from an early russian folk tale  this is an awesome story  because of kind acts towards three beggars  an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack  a deck of cards  and a nice whistle  which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil death   the true bride   from an early german folk tale  shades of aslan  a white lion comes to the aid of a girl  jane horrocks  little voice  being held under the cruel care of a troll  costarring sean bean   the three ravens   from an early german folk tale  a wicked witch  miranda richardson  weds a widowed king  jonathan pryce  and then  recognizing that

it the other way around   as a beautiful princess  the unimpressive alison doody   seeking to escape an arranged marriage  flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag  but  then  she falls in love with the princecostarring jennifer saunders   the heartless giant   from an early german folk tale  on the whole  giants are benign creatures  harmless to none  unless  of

__label__0 this book is a sure snoozefest  luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class  we read selected chapters of the book  they writing was horrible  many parts were unclear  i had to reread what i read over and over  i ca nt stand this style of writing  barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent  instead  he comes off as boring and pretentious  skip this book  try something else
__label__0 this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion  it is not a manual nor a guide  no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book  the style is simbolic and poetical  it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content  it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work

__label__0 the author makes a couple of valuable points  first  any longterm investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent  secular   ie  indefinitely long  bear markets  most leading investment advisors recommend a  buy and hold  strategy  but this only works during predominately bull market periods  most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent  bull market  which is anomalous in historical terms  the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that  buy and hold  does nt always provide the best returns  obviously  then  it s better to pull out during the bear markets  but that s easier said than done  the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets  including p  e ratio  interest and inflation rates  and gdp  the problem is that those characteristics do nt always correlate with market performance  for example  this book was written in  and the author predicted a bear market  well  if you heeded his advice  you would have missed the bull market of    and early   especially in smallmid caps and foreign stocks  even with high p  e ratios  a bull market can continue for several years  witness the late s  it s virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis  there is so much volatility on a daily  weekly  monthly  and yearly basis that s it s impossible to know when the market has switched directions  by the time that it is apparent  it s too late to profit  even in the midst of great bull markets  there might be week  month  or even yearlong downturns  the author says nothing about individual stock picking  beyond a general value approach  the book is all about big picture  long term trends  another problem is that the author s predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to  but the market  and economy  is a different beast now that it was in the s  s  s  and s  as they say  past performance does not predict future returns  the investment advice provided here is not useful  he suggests a  portfolio of hedge funds   ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of k  he also recommends a  bond ladder   an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund  and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations  i do nt need to spend  and five hours reading to learn that  one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility  which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations  volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for  most studies just average the returns across years  but that does nt reflect real returns  let s say you invest k into a stock that returns  the first year and  the second  your average return should be  a year  right  wrong  at the end of the first year you have k  minus  the second year leaves you with k total  equal to  a year compounded  if you had received  a year compounded  your final total would be over k  that s k difference in just  years  and the volatility costs add up  the book is very poorly written  plodding  sooooo boring  with tons of repetition  just as an example  the graph showing the  y curve  relationship between p  e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than  times

__label__1 this was the first vi warshawski book i ever read  and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more  i think paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into vi s world  which is rich with unique characters  vi comes across as individualistic and principled  and i like how paretsky resisted cliché temptation on several counts  the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book  and there is no  quot  obligatory sex scene  quot  not that sex scenes do nt have their places  but i just hate it when i m reading along and i can almost hear the agent say   quot  okay  author  you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book  quot  in this story  vi is all business  which is a delightful change of pace

__label__1 unfortunately  millions of americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress  anxiety  and depression  in the pharmaceutical industry  antianxiety medications and antidepressants are among the bestselling medications on the market  the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear  and reasonably so  in recent years  taking an antianxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin  however  the side effects and longterm effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently  in the past year  some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light  much to the horror of patients and physicians alike  antianxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction  severe withdrawal  weight gain  vertigo  and even suicide and death  to treat the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  without negative health implications  many are now turning to natural supplements   safely and with much success  most consumers are confused about which natural stress  anxiety  and depression supplements to take  fortunately  there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results  safely  the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one s that are based more on marketing hype  it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study  and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product  this is the key to getting the results you desire  freedom from stress  anxiety  and depression  after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain lowgrade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective  there are a few  however  with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses  these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress  anxiety  and depression  after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended  here is a list of the top the top  stress  anxiety and depression supplements on the market today    anxietol   tm    welatonin  tm    pinadol  tm    seredyn  tm    prosera  tm    amoryn  tm    euphorx  tm    herbval supra  tm    clarocetnri  tm    relora  tm
__label__1 there are two different types of larkin poem  the first type  mostly written before   are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre  the second  written when he found his voice  are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written  so what was his voice  basically that of twentieth century man  atheistic  obsessed with sex  regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties  he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems  but here s the really incredible thing  he uses ordinary  uncomplicated language  no tricks  no arcane allusions  just plain english  it ca nt be denied that the voice is bleak  and it is too uncompromising for some  however  those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives

__label__1 mark l  sirower s thoughtprovoking and complex book is actually a critically acclaimed academic study that challenges the reasoning behind corporate acquisitions  pointing out that acquisitions usually devalue the acquiring companies  a loss from which they rarely recover   sirower delves into management fundamentals and mathematical analyses to get to the bottom of merger and acquisition problems  three detailed appendices feature plenty of financial calculations  performance measures and data from various corporate acquisitions to back up his assertions  we  recommend this book to those involved in mergers and acquisitions and to other readers intrigued by the inside view of this  carnivorous quest
__label__1 the first wayne s world provides all the necessary background  but number  is actually better because it has a longer list of interesting cameo appearances  including starkly realistic versions of jim morrison and sammy davis  jr  spoofing the oliver stone film  jfk   in the desert
__label__0 this movie has the feel of a latenight monster fest hosted by svengoolie or elvira  i had no idea what this was about when i started watching it  but by the end  i wished i would have skipped it entirely  the story starts off well  with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster  that you do nt see at first   from there it goes downhill  it felt like a lowrent  pet sematary  i have never read the short story that this was based off of  but i m sure that king made his scarier than this movie could ever be  the best acting in the movie comes from brad dourif  best known for his performance as billy bibbit in  one flew over the cuckoo s nest  and the voice of chucky the killer doll from  child s play   as an exterminator
__label__0 i got this as both a book and an audio file  i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author  but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts  eg  i gasped when he suggested christ went to hellwhat bible passage evidences this    i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleepbut wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations  where were his editors when this was being written  why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities  i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those  conservatives  frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on  i did appreciate his story about daniel and the  delayed  angelbut am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too  what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me  we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material wellthe bible well  so fari may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself  i wonder if i can get a refund
__label__0 this maybe the worst interface i have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with dos interfaces  edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the mcafee s security center  there is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening xp s admin tools and then forcing the services to stop  which is not a recommenable approach for the average user  here is a short list of the probelms that i encountered  counter spy is cheaper  easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly   cannot select to disable during noninternet use so i can run software that security center has conflicts with like protools  recording software   the scan results are vague  ie returns  quarantined threats but does nt display what the threats are and you ca nt print the result either   there are more  there are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide
__label__1 leonaur ltd is publishing the definitive edgar rice burroughs st century editions  these usually contain  books of the different erb major series in order  thus far john carter  pellucidar  and carson of venus  in the future  possibly tarzan  these books are handsome and my rating is mainly based on this  the erb fan knows best about the rest of it  this first volume of joh carter of mars contains    of the greatest science fiction  fantasy trilogy ever  what is nore remarkable is that these were published over  years before tolkien s lotr and over  before tolkien became fashionable   a princess of mars    the gods of mars   and  the warlord of mars  are erb s greatest work  it is sad  in a way  that tarzan obscures erbs mars novels for the general public  these books deserve to be beter known  and it is astonishing no movie or tv adaptation has ever been attempted  which might be a good thing  after all    if only steven spielberg or peter jackson were interested  of course  genre and erb aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories  i wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent ballantine editions of the s  if you are a fan as am i  support leonaur ltd s efforts by buying these magnificent books

__label__1 i was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product   it s as we we ve purchased entirely different programs  in my experience with this software  i ve found it to be extremely smoothrunning and userfriendly from installation to printing  and the card selection and customization is second to none  there have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we ve customized them countless ways   adding and editing photos  moving text  sending ecards  you name it  navigating within the art studio is very intuitive  printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the onscreen configuration works great  unlike some of the other reviews  i have nt had the problem of having to reconfigure every time i print  we set it up once and that was it  i ve printed on card stock paper  which turns out gorgeous  and we ve also printed the quarterfold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size a envelopes  this is a great printing option if you do nt want to buy card stock paper    i ve used this software on all of my computers  have recommended it to many people  and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems  i highly recommend it  it s a fun program  the recipients will love their customized cards  and it will save you money in the long run

__label__0 i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital  the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used  the delay between pictures is incredibly long  the lens  shutter does nt open properly   two other family members who own powershot a s are having the same problems
__label__0 as some of the other reviewers have mentioned  this us release has replaced the original source music  but the region  version has been released without these cuts  so for everyone with a multiregion player  i d suggest using amazoncouk to buy a copy there instead
__label__0 this is no doubt the worse product i have ever purchased from amazon  i would return it or perhaps i should throw in the trash  the weight varies if you step on it within a  minute interval enormously  it is horrible
__label__0 having used turbo tax since  i feel that i am qualified to comment on it  i have also used quicken  quicken deluxe  quicken home  business  quickbooks pro   quickbooks premier contractors edition  the turbo tax product seems to get more user unfriendly each year  the navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early s  like i said i was using quickbooks pro  until tax time last year  i purchased turbo tax home  business like i had for the past  years  and really got a shock when i found out that it would not import my data from quickbooks pro  three year old software that was not compatible with turbo tax in   actually  tax year   i ended up purchasing quickbooks premier contractors edition     in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done  intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed  i am done with them and will purchase taxcut this year

__label__1 up front  if you re considering this lens  stop considering  and buy it  i had occasion to try the tamaron zoom in this range and noticed plasticy digital qualities in some of the tamaron s highlightedtexture areas  none of that is a problem with this canon beauty  i am using it as my normal lens  the contrast is razorsharp enough to shave with  it s graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a tv camera  it s also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical abs  tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges  and there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges  photoshop nails the latter deader than britney spears  career  i ve had a need for reasonably large blowups  with most captures cropped  yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally x at that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject s pores  but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters
__label__0 alright  for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals  or lacking in substance  i say this  who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are  who is rand to say what substance is  you ve got to look at her bias  first  realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom  as if outside factors never matter  and maybe they do nt  for her  maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today  but i doubt it  though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live  outside influences do affect a person  but she doesnt  thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap  all books that are not driven solely by the individual s sense of reason  do nt read  cause it will lessen your iq  any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does nt find worthwhile or cannot understand  she condemns  rand  at least as portrayed in what i ve read of her work  is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants  and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes  they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality  they are either good or worthless  the pieces of art she says are empty are empty  absolutely  they do nt fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer  nothing to offer her  that is  how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history s best books  telling other people  with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual  what they should read  truthfully any criticism in this form  like a list i saw detailing the  best literary works in the world  is elitist crap trying to close people s minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others  they have their bias like anyone else  i say read in variety  observe art outside of rand s choice of art  take in all you can  with an open mind  then start pondering whether you agree or not  if you then agree because you agree  then i say great  its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address  she says question society  but by my line of inquiry  she says be an individual  but only i know the basis of who you want to be
__label__1 i m a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings  this program fits all of my basic needs  this is the first piece of audio software i ve ever owned but i know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what i guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you ve used audition  or cooledit  however  as my introduction to music editing  the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and i like the endless options adobe provides for organizing the workspace  one tip  if you are a student or teacher  do nt spend   do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over
__label__1 i bought this product specifically because it was originally described as being  having  moodbrightening natural spectrum light   i thought it would help on the gloomy pacific northwest winter days  i got it on a friday sale price  so it seemed like a good value for the product description given here  the lamp just arrived  a few days ago  when i originally submitted this review   and the product s faq sheet states this product is  designed only to provide excellent quality light for daily tasks and hobbies  this lamp does not offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the national institute of mental health for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder  sad   the product literature packed with the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers  moodbrightening  light  because of this glaring misrepresentation  i am currently debating whether to the return the lamp  i agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive labels  there are two  are very sticky and difficult to remove completely  i used a combination of methods to remove the adhesive residue  and i agree with the comments about the company name being printed on the front of the lamp  when i saw it in the picture  i thought it had to be some kind of company watermark or logo for the stock photo only  so i was shocked to see  verilux  actually printed  embossed into the lamp housing  in a very prominent location on the front of the lamp  very cheesy  for a lamp of this price point and quality  if you re looking for a  clean  bright light  in a stylish  portable lamp  this is not a bad choice  but if you re looking for a fullspectrum light that does offer some light  therapy   this is probably the wrong choice  the company does have other   therapeutic  lighting options  but at a higher price point  nov    update  i was concerned enough about the original  misleading product description that i submitted my concerns to amazon  i now see that the description had been revised since submitting those concerns  i want to thank amazon for their very prompt response in correcting the product description  which should help other buyers make a moreinformed decision

__label__1 i have a powerbook  an imac  and an emac at home that are used in different ways  the kids use the emac for school work  and my wife  i use the other  macs for home business  although most school work was required in mspowerpoint or msword  exporting from iwork   pages and keynote was very simple to do with  accuracy  our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work  for home business  we use pages to do our proposals  bills  and receipts  and use keynote for presentations  one thing that i thought was amazing  is the fact that i can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my powerbook  while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see  for the price of the family pack  we were licensed to use iwork   on  macs on the same network  the cost fitted our budget perfectly  the only thing i wish was available in keynote was timed transition  example  after  seconds show bullet  after  seconds show bullet  after  seconds show the chart
__label__1 this is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs  also check out elaine petrone s miracle balls  which you can also use in the car and for other things  the support is sturdy and has a mesh back  which helps to keep you cool and comfortable  a great deal for the cost
__label__0 understand  i love springsteen  born to run is my second favorite album of all time  i have seen him live over a dozen times  i personally think he is the single most important american rock and roll artist ever  with apologies to elvis  chuck berry and dylan   i even loved nebraska  so do nt tell me it s an estreet band thing or a rock versus folk thing  but this album is unlistenable  some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful  that s rubbish  there is a complete absence of melody on this record  as was the case with much of the ghost of tom joad album  with a huge exception being  youngstown   a great song   the apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like woody guthrie or jimmy rodgers is just frightening  dylan could pull it off  bruce just disappoints  but it s the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure  believe  i listened to devil  dust  times in hopes of finding what i am apparently missing  i couldnt  i thought the rising was a nice album  i even liked the devils  dust solo tour  bruce is a powerful performer  and maybe even more commading when it s just him on stage   but i doubt this cd will ever find its way back into the player
__label__1 but a good debut album  this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny  no radio friendly s here just street for the most part  but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you ca nt keep talkin about it  which is why i guess he changed his style  now the subject i wanna hit  has anyone noticed that guy named progressive  why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture  and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker  junkie hippie  last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music  i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock  i m tired of our music bein trashed  you know what im a go trash one of they  artist  right now
__label__0 i ordered this digital frame for my husband for christmas  with the assurance from a  tech weenie  that it would work  based on the advertisement found at amazon  still uncertain whether the ad  also found in philips cursory literature  is really true  my husband is working with the  phone people  at philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with mac  if it does eventually work  the process has not been easy

__label__0 spyware doctor was a fine malware detection product  but it is now broken  i ve used various versions for quite a while  windows   windows xp  but  is not working reliably  sd will not keep running on xp  the new  program unloads the onguard  immunizer functions without warning on xp  the speed issue had been a problem  even with  gb ram   but they seemed to have addressed that issue before  on vista  will not uninstall  when you attempted to uninstall  it sends you to their website telling you how great the product is  when you ask tech support for help  they suggest uninstalling using safe mode  which cannot connect to their website   spyware doctor will not uninstall using  windows installer cleanup utility  msicuu  as there is no entry  the vista machine hangs and stalls  the obnoxious redirection to the pctools website puts this product in the spyware category  their tech support has been very slow  during the week  during business hours for a subscribed user with multiple purchased units   next
__label__1 this is my first review but i just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program  i bought this game when my children were in kindergarten and second grade  fritz and chester s program is so engaging  there are rhymes and chants for each piece s moves as well as for some other  strategytype  moves  for example   a knight on the rim is ugly and dim   what a great way to teach kids to keep their knights inplay  this program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies  i would recommend getting fritz and chester  now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play  my boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade  their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments  fritz and chester  is also great and my boys  now in third and sixth grade  still play it
__label__1 abby cooper has become my favorite amateur pi  the premise of this series  a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases  is original and fun to read  abby is a psychic  but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman  money  sibling and romance issues  in this latest book  abby  her sister cat  and abby s handyman dave  buy and plan to renovate a house  only the house turns out to be haunted  poor dave  abbey s partner and handyman  is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation  determined to find out what s going on  abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to wwii nazi germany  in order to solve the mystery  abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case  there is danger for abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between abby and dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple  ms laurie has a great series going here  and i look forward to reading more abby mysteries
__label__0 there are two thing that i do nt like about this set  the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is nt attached to the base which is very inconvenient  i would nt recommend them
__label__0 sounds like the background music used in the  s rockford files tv crime showand a little like the chips music too  similar to music by tom scott from back then  the crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky  they are more smooth groovin funk  the sound for the times is very clean  too produced for true funkyness  do nt get me wrong i like the old  s jazz crusaders  just not this  s phase of their careerthey sold out to a large extent  and continue to do so  it s where the money is  no improvisatory feel either  this is for smooth jazz lovers  hard funk lovers will be disappointed  as will true jazzers  i wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the  s but they keep burying it like it never happened  even to this day  afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid  late  s true jazz albums  their  s albums like this are partly to blame for today s smooth jazz  in other words  not really jazz  not really funky  just kind of smooth groovin  more for casual adults and offices  not challenging  not offensive  formulated to an extent  but hey if you like this  that s cool  just dont think it s real jazz  or real funk  it s smooth and casual  slightly simmers  pleasant background music  but does nt cook like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz  funk  and fusion  it just sounds like they are holding backi know they can play more advanced  and write more creatively  they just choose not to ever since the  s
__label__1 the first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it s almost impossible to say one is better that the others  taken together  they are almost like one long album  the family that plays together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity  their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first  randy california s influence on the music was becoming stronger as well  one thing that differd spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert  i saw the original version  times and they never failed to astound me  it s a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later ed cassidy  randy california version  not that the later versions of the band were nt great  they just were nt quite as good as the original band  if youre just being introduced to spirit  the family that plays together is a fine place to start
__label__0 even as a joke  this would be horrible  however  i think this band take it seriously  and it blows  i picked up this cd because i heard are were like a combination of suicide  front   and iron maiden  interesting  no   are are a bad imitation of front  and watereddown liars at best  the guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse  example   hey world  begins with how much it sucks to be  when i saw pelican in concert  they were opening        for are  so i decided to give them a second chance  the sound guy must not have liked what he heard  because the bar chatter was louder   louder  i yelled  so that i might find something redeeming in their music   yeah  suck louder   someone else yelled  i had to agree  give him a highfive  maybe i would have liked this when i was  and did nt know any better  zero stars
__label__1 this is my favorite toning workout and i m sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tonefest  what i like best about it is that i can customize it to whatever body part i think needs the most work this week  need a  minute ab workout  you can choose it  think the arms and legs need work  no problem  want to tone a little bit of everything  you can do that  too  the instructors are all good  clear  not irritating  and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part  it s not your standard crunches for ab work on this video  this was one of my best purchases  workoutwise  i wish there were more dvd s  workouts out there with minna lessig  she is my favorite instructor  she does the arm  leg workouts on this dvd   the other two instructors are wonderful as well  and the workout just seems to fly by  although at the end you do know you ve worked those muscle groups
__label__0 so far  so goodso what   in it s origional form  used to conjure feeling  the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did nt quite hit the nail on the head  if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late s  get your hands on that version
__label__0 another torrent of mild tripe from everyone s  favourite  dj  tiesto  what on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane  pastelcoloured eurovomit dance music runs out  when i think about the number of times i ve heard him touted as  world s number one best voted dj  or  dj mag top  finalist   you d start to think that the man can actually mix records  when in fact rather than mix them  he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new  unusual and horrendously nauseating forms  i can absolutely confirm this  i have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live  the sad truth of the matter is  that there are any number of drugaddicted fluoropantswearing  year old ravers out there  and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this  or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas  i sign off in disgust
__label__0 i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd  we were barely able to make it through one listening  this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist  using the term very loosely  not already been famous for something besides music  the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling  it only gets a star because that s the lowest rating  i want my money back
__label__1 not only is this beauty wide  i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d  it is built solid and focus s fast  and i do nt have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly  buy this lens  it is cheap for what you get

__label__0 i have owned this camera for  months and have finally deciced to replace it  i bought this camera to replace another nikon coolpix that was stolen from my house  but this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use  i have always liked nikon cameras but the s just does nt make it  i can not use it outside because i can not see the lcd screen  sorry nikon but you blew it on this camera   so i replaced it with a canon powershot a what a difference in ease of use and  it has a view finder  also my g memory card from rhe nikon fots in the new canon
__label__0 i must have missed something about this book  i ca nt believe that minority report and total recall  two movies that i did enjoy  came from this author  the stories seem to be missing something  perhaps  this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read
__label__0 first they started out as numetal  then they moved onto metalcore  and now psuedodeath metal  it should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends  and after each trend dies  they just move on to another one  if my calculations are correct  expect a psuedoblack metal release  but  what about the musicians  sure  they have a fast drummerwho likes to trigger alot  then they have two guitaristswho like to steal pantera riffs  and then they have the singer  who  well  sounds just like all the rest  atleast they dont have the dj anymore  oh wait  they do  nevermind   enough of my rambling  how does this untalented group of posers fair up  well  image if mushroomhead went metalcore   nuff said  avoid
__label__0 the  bad serial number  routine as the first reviewer  i ll try adobe customer service when i stop fuming
__label__0 the mac os   list  often cheaper  does nt get viruses  worms  malware  etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc  with the exception of some games  go to a mac store and try it for yourself
__label__1 i bought this camera to replace my  almost a couple years back  i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors  after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here s the lowdown  pros  picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full x  i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures  although this camera is nt too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom   prints that i ve made up to x   have nt gone larger  but i know i can  are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a x it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick  the stabilization at full x zoom is incredible also  it appears really shaky through the window  but pictures continue to turn out crisp  closeups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details  the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion  read cons   cons  indoor shooting is limited because the flash is nt strong enough  when at a school chorus concert  the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear  award ceremonies  the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards  the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie  this camera seems to eat batteries  especially in the winter months  i am always on the go  and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again  it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me  the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere  but that also is minor  most of the cons really are all minor things that do nt interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues  i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible  all in all  i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer  if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities  just keep in mind for the flash to work good  keep your subjects close  it s been bumped  jostled  and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem
__label__1 nine months ago i was hired to help turnaround a once successful business  from day one i realized that this was a company without focus  it s one thing to define a problem  another to find a solution  haneberg s book was a shot in the arm  just one concept    stop multitasking    would have been a major breakthrough for my team  and  personally  the idea of doing  one great thing  has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job  this book immediately rose to the rank of three or four  must read  titles in my business library  in the couple of months since i first read it  and i ve reread it a couple of times  our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions   we re nailing deadlines  we re closing more sales  we re thinking more strategically across the board  in a business and social environment that throws more at us daybyday  hourbyhour  this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago  we re all doing more with less   and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities  if it s true  as woody allen says  that  of success is showing up  then the other  is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there  this is the manual for getting your business   and your life   where you want it to be
__label__0 i bought this book this weekend as we re doing the prefive in a row w  our preschooler and i do nt much like it  i ve got a mother w  borderline personality disorder and who does nt observe personal boundaries of other s whatsoever  if i need a break away  she hunts down my poor husband  all my relatives and friends  ugh  and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her  stalker mom  mentality  in the end  i think if a person is from a seminormal household w  proper respect for a child s boundaries and need for space away from their parents  then this book is okay  i just find some moms are too smoothering  even ones w  o personality disorders  and this book does nt send a message about love as much as  i own you  i like  mama do you love me   better for explaining to a child a parent s unconditional love   goodnight moon  by margaret wise brown  however  is by far my children s all time favorite book  i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed  they love it and so do we as parents  but this one even creeped my hubby out and he s from a fairly  normal  family  take it w  a grain of salt
__label__1 i ca nt believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album  not a lot of in between among the notices   those that hate are mean and heartless  very hurtful  lousy counterpoint to her warmth  i do nt think they understand that she does nt have to lose control to be meaningful and touching  take her as an original instead of as a mimic  what do i hear  i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch s brilliant piano accompaniment  bill frisell is very good  too  i love jazz  pop as well as opera  ren  e fleming can make it any of these genres  these songs are very much her own interpretation  they are  deeper  than what you ve heard before  even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing  you ve changed   ren  e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully  in her own style  and very touching  too  she s not carried by full orchestration  mostly just fred and her  i was going to write that  my one and only love  was especially good  but as the cd kept playing  i must say that they are all especially good  enjoy
__label__1 john michael mongomery is back with a big bang  this album is one of the best to come out this year  it s better than that of travis tritt  alan jackson  and kenny chesney  the song i wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since alan s where were you  he mixes the soulful ballads  with his country rockers  and sweet love songs  this is vinatage jmm and should be bought by any true country music fan
__label__1 over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs  at age  those needs are many  after approximately two rounds of trying  it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general
__label__0 very seldom do i give up on a book  i gave up on this one after several attempts to finish  i have read barbara delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books  i remember the fascination with the peyton place  grace metalious hoopla in the  s and  s so i was expecting to enjoy this story  it is dull and tiresome
__label__0 casual book browsers who stumble across braden s book   the isaiah effect   might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title  that there exists some mystical  unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques  research  and understanding  i  as one such browser  had briefly read about the socalled  bible code  which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related  with my interest piqued at the title and the book description  i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah s  precise instructions  of prayer  i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon  what i found in this  page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of newthought concepts  the mixing of religions  for example  a sort of pickandchoose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades  is recycled over and over again  drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books  in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah  instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence  in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah  his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science  his basic premise of  the effect  is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present  such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all  any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel  and the world  of turning away from him  to braden s credit  his discussions of the effects of prayer in today s society are commemorable  albeit somewhat misguided  i agree with him that people in today s society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they ve surrounded themselves  however  i believe braden overemphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer  he fails to discuss how humans  and their emotions  are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes  braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts  in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created  humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer  not cosmic emotions and human feelings  a disappointing read
__label__1 this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal  who has been recording for ecm for  years now  the tracks range from pieces with an  quot  electric milesquot  sound to an orchestrated track  while very diverse  the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique  atmospheric tone and excellent compositions  the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to  bit mastering  informative liner notes as well  highly recommended
__label__0 after reading glowing reviews of the dbts i picked up three of their cds  while some of the lyrics are strong  the songs have no melodies whatsoever  most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer  they re reputed to be carrying on the tradition of skynyrd and the allmans  but those bands were nt just loud guitarsthey had memorable tunes and great singers  dbts are a huge letdown
__label__1 the essential jimmie rodgers  is highly recommended for any serious country music fan  if anyone is the genuine article  it is jimmie  listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including  frankie and johnny    mule skinner blues  and  t for texas   there are also fine versions of  waitin  for a train  and  in the jailhouse now  though some may prefer jerry lee lewis  version of the former and the webb pierce recording of the latter  the most interesting tracks are less well known  these include  my old pal    my old sunny south by the sea  and one devoted not to a mother but a father      daddy and home   for this reviewer  the album hit its high point on the final track  a mournful  tb blues   a reference to the disease that took jimmie s life at  while jimmie s yodeling style may not be for everyone  this reviewer considers this album a safe bet  keep in mind that jr was elected to both the country and rock and roll hall of fame  further  the  essential  series of albums rarely disappoints  these almost always sponsor well  produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts   the essential jimmie rodgers  certainly falls into that category
__label__0 sorry  guys  i think that the cover says it all  totally out of focus and falling apart  i much prefer his later work

__label__0 this is a pep rally on cd  an unsingable  emotionally charged pep rally  it really upsets me that this is the face of today s christian music  the melodies are not easily singable at all  and the songs use all the same musical cliches  this is worship manipulation at it s best  if you read the words to learn something concrete about god  you will find nothing of substance  they talk about actions to give god and our response to god  but no meatandpotatoes of why we should be doing this  god is great  but why  this is very disturbing  and completely unacceptable for congregational worship
__label__0 i had my sony dsc w for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit  the glass itself was intact  but something underneath was clearly broken  mailed it in to the factory service company for sony  and i was informed  weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost  to repair  this is    the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially  i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera
__label__0 absolute waste of money  this is not a pillow as advertised  in my opinion falsely  but a flat mat which  when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this  you could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all  an extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution  now out of pocket and no better off

__label__1 barbershop is a rare event in africanamerican filmmaking  it s one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for africanamericans  i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the africanamerican community is  we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen  i really liked this movie  we definitely need more films like this calvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father  mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes  calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life  it s not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood  there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they re all easy to follow  one follows a stolen atm machine  one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant  another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend  another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview  and yet another follows a white barber s quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with  in a way  this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories  each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop  director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop  i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop  watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy  it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flattop trimmed  both are closed now     there are a ton of great performances in this movie  i m probably going to miss mentioning a few people  ice cube is great as calvin  i liked his performance here  michael ealy stands out in his role as an excon trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber  ealy makes you feel his characters  desperation  cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber  he s funny and poignant  sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college  anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it  watching them try to open will make you laugh  keith david is creepy as the loan shark  then again  keith david is always good in anything he does  i d pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages  i do nt know why movie critics and the rev  jesse jackson denounced barbershop  it s one of the best movies ever made about africanamerican life  looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman  africanamericans actually want more films like this  as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community  not just one small part of it  i for one and tired of the  hood  movies like never die alone  and critically acclaimed movies like monster s ball and hustle  flow that depict black life as something negative   thankfully  it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too  the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up   end of rant  back to the review  a shawn james essential five star video  you must buy this movie  get some friends together put the dvd in the machine  pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop

__label__1 excellent camera kit  versatile  i have a lot to learn about the camera  though  as it is no simple pointandshoot  however  in auto mode  it takes great pointandshoot pictures  i look forward to learning how to use it fully  lenses came with warranty cards  but the camera itself did not  i bought the sb flash as well and another battery and two  gb compact flash cards to round out the kit  camera with lens attached is large  which i underestimated   camera bag is too small for it all  great camera  though  price was the best i could find anywhere
__label__0 another film in the neverending series of  giant animated snake eats people  films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade  the creators of a maximumsecurity prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the tenmillionplus slumber of foot hungry reptile  there s nothing more to this film than that   boa   also known as  new alcatraz   actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness  which i do nt think was a smart idea  the technical team  photography  production designset decoration  etc  create a fairly effective  chilling atmosphere  but everything else about  boa  is strictly routine  dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable  although elizabeth lackey is just that  lacking  as his wife  and the supporting cast  mark sheppard  grand l  bush  craig wasson  is just a touch more professional  the filmmakers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca nt see just how fake it looks  i do nt really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with  other  similar titles include  python   and    anaconda   the original hokey animated killer snake movie of   and  anaconda  search for the blood orchid   and the inevitable  boa vs python   the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors
__label__0 there s nothing you can tell clearly about this movie  because from the very beginning to the end  i ve just heard lota f words  fthis  fthat  typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks  and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid  and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked  and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness  or if they thought by simply using this big f word and they could kill thy kingdom come  then america might not look like what we re seeing now  maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world  maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what  they re just using that word to kill each other  or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big f word to talk the talk  i do nt have any clue  man
__label__1 this is fantastic  great music  great story  awesome photography  i promise you will love this film
__label__0 i was nt pleased with this book  i ve read all of ms warren s ebooks and i have to say they have a lot more fire  she lost a lot in this book  somewhere around the middle of the book  i started thinking  did i actually buy a book this bad   because i enjoyed her e books so much i did nt stop to think before purchasing it  i was so happy to have her book  i immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book  boy  did i get it from her the next day  because we do nt believe in throwing money away  we re still stuggling to finish the book  hopefully  there is light at the end of the tunnel
__label__0 sarah brightman is one of my all time favorite artists  but this disc is just a complete waste  it is missing so much  and has too many songs that do nt belong  like the phantom songs  as much as i love them  save them for the andrew llyod webber collections  ca nt we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from  dive   her  classics  album had it right  except their version of  captain nemo  was the rip off live version  and this cd does nt even have the captain nemo song  which is a huge fan favorite  and definitly was a single  it is also missing how can heaven love me  eden  harem  and beautiful  all singles as well  save your money  either buy the  classics  album for a somewhat better compilation  or just make your own mix like i did  because sarah has so many wonderful songs  and quite a few bad ones i will admit  and it seems on here they give you some bad ones  like requium and nella fantasia   and leave out the good ones   it s a beautiful day  and  what you never know  are good  but are the weakest songs form harem  why on earth would you leave out  harem  and  beautiful   but leave on beautiful day and wynk  whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in  i bet sarah did nt have much say in this compilation  this is just a waste  beautiful album cover though
__label__0 i bought one and it worked great  at first it s hard to manuever because it s really hot  and the barrel s bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot  but once you get used to it  it does a stellar job of straightening your hair  around  months into using the straightner  the machine slowly overheated and died  thinking i had a faulty model  i went out and bought a new one  guess what  a few months into that one  it ended the same way  so basically  not worth it
__label__1 i bought finale songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols  it worked well for my project  i have no complaints
__label__0 when printing cards it leaves a large border around front of card graphics  the cards do not print anything like they are shown on box display with front of card display taking up the whole card  when i contacted tech support i was advised that in order to correct this problem my printer must have a borderless printing option  my printer does not  i have been using another major greeting card software for about a year and half and never had this problem with that program  there is nothing on the outside of box under the system requirements that states this  on the outside of the box it says you can return for refund if not satified within  days and that the details are in the box  there are not any details in the box and when i contacted the company i got run around in circles stating there were two companies involved with the software and was never given information on how it could be returned  i am stuck with it

__label__1 pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics  providing examples of practical application of each  this helps the reader develop a critical mind  capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis  pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws  such as cultural and ethical relativism  the reader will find that pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular  but rather calls for reason and judgment  based on strong moral principles  in every situation  some situtations call for a utilitarian approach  some for a virtueethical approach  whatever approach he takes  however  will be based in thorough and sound reasoning  this book makes its readers want to be better people
__label__0 jun  as the book progressed  it got more and more egoistic  to the point where it becomes a turnoff towards the end of the book  i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem  shaq s attitude seems to be that since he can score  he does not respect centers who ca nt score  whereas he respect bill russell  but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight  the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq  so this is a big improvement
__label__1 very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery
__label__0 i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage  for years  it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade  i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do nt think my latest sites would be up yet  sorry  i do nt mean to be mean  it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically  i m sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade  i do nt know
__label__1 caine s book is by far the most practical book on acting i ve read  and i ve read a few  some are very beautifuly written  poetic and psychological  but for someone who really wants to learn something about acting for film  i would recommend this book first  it is at times bleakly honest but highly readable  if you ve done any acting  you ll find yourself nodding frequently
__label__0 this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties gfunk heyday  warren g  did nt even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard  soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before  the skits are ridiculous  the music is halfass  and the lyrics are amateur  there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener s attention for a whole album  this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as wc and the madd circle s debut and coolio s  it takes a thief   one star for the hit single  summertime in the lbc
__label__1 we purchased this program on the recommendation of a friend because we have a yrold grandson who s very interested in art and is comfortable with computers  turns out his older sister has the program in school  kindergarten  they both enjoy having this to play with when they visit
__label__1 the concert in central park is not only the best of simon  garfunkel s concerts  it is one of the best of anyone s concerts  in my estimation  the crowd was really in to it  and simon and garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music  and the era it was written in  i have owned the vcr tape for years  and enjoyed it many times  but the signal was beginning to fade  so i was very pleased to see it released on dv
__label__1 every singer ends up attempting sinatra eventually  but few manage so well  john pizzarelli has been playing jazz guitar with his legendary father  bucky  since he was  years old  john s latest album is dear mr sinatra  on which he plays songs written for ol  blue eyes  the crooner is noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative voice  which recall the relaxed stylings of nat  king  cole and chet baker  as well as for his fluid  inventive guitar playing  on this album of covers of songs made famous by frank sinatra  john pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of ol  blue eyes imitations in favor of his own intimate approach  best heard on the set s more relaxed arrangements  my highlights are the tracks  i ve got you under my skin    nice and easy  and  you make me feel so young   both attentiongrabbing and supportive  his expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the ringadingding of the rat pack era while steering clear of mere pastiche  with a total time just under  minutes  the program is a little short by cd standards  but the performances by john pizzarelli and the claytonhamilton jazz orchestra in this warm tribute to frank sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit the mark every time
__label__1 i am enjoying the talk now  learn bulgarian cd  great images  repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words  numbers  time  etc easy  also  the games add interest  you can print out each section with photos and words in bulgarian  however  i would have liked to see the program come with the cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide

__label__1 now that i m writing this review  it seems silly that i m so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush  but i am  i bought this item not long after i had my first  and hopefully only  root canal and crown four years ago  something which i never again want to experience in my life  as someone else described  it was painful and expensive   growing up  i did nt take care of my teeth like i should ve  so i m accustomed to always being told there s either a cavity  or the start of one  and having to have more work done  after the root canal  my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations  oscillations  because that s what she d been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums  this specific item met those requirements  and it was affordable  when i first started using it  my gums were very sensitive to it  but that quickly wore off  so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums  it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth  subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a highquality electric toothbrush such as this one  i honestly do nt remember if she has this exact model  but ours are similar   and i ve not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it  as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from  gunking  up  i m the only person who uses this item  so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in  not dripping into the storage container  so i do nt know how to combat that  but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it  then rinse the handheld part  and set them back on the unplugged charger  base  i only plug it in when the battery runs low  and things stay clean with no problem
__label__0 i bought this from another retailer on  black friday  for half of what amazon is selling it for and i m still bringing it back  i think it s horrible  i was so excited to get a minidv camcorder because i heard how great the picture was  but this takes horrible video  it comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything  even using the light  even in a fairly welllit room it came out dark  it looked ok on the lcd screen  but when i hooked it up to the tv  horrible  and it s not my tv either because i hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine  i love that it s so small  but if i ca nt see the video  it s no use to me  back to by big old sony

__label__1 i purchased this tripod from th street photo through amazoncom  the tripod appeared to arrive in good shape  except that the operating instructions were not included  i immediately emailed th stree photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment  i asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions  they did not respond to my email  so a few days later i emailed them again  once again  no response  i then emailed amazoncom  and informed them of the missing instructions and the nonresponses from th street photo  no response from amazon either  as far as the tripod goes  it appears to be a very good value for the money  i gave it  rather than  stars because  due to the missing operating instructions  i cannot be certain i have properly checked out all of its features  however  i am certain that both th street photo and amazoncom rate zero stars for customer service  i will use neither one again
__label__0 this kit conveniently contains  sheets of photo paper  unfortunately  kodak does nt contain an ink cartridge for them  fine  i thought  i ll buy a separate cartridge  guess what  you ca nt  kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper  why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges  seems pretty dirty
__label__0 too hard to use  so i paid  for an  hairdryer  maybe if i watched the video  i could use it bette
__label__0 most people seem to like the soundtrack from  glory   but this fact does not necessarily make  glory  a great  or even good soundtrackmost people also like the food served atmacdonald s  but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbersit is something to put in one s mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungrythe same might be said regarding  glory  if one s tastes run to choir music  almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found hereas for the themes  they are commonplace variations  often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer  or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores  so  all in all  the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap   homestyle  dinerthe film  on the other hand  was well done  and  apparently  from reading many of the other reviews here  the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself  rather than very much standalone praise for the scorehorner has written a lot of really  really beautiful and original scores  but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or littlenoticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatnessso  in sum  we are left with a very popular film  provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
__label__1 i ll be honest  i do nt like fiction books  but i ve got to tell you  a mulligan for bobby jobe has changed my mind  mr cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place  the twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience  you do nt need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel  can lightning strike twice  absolutely
__label__1 i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for  it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films  but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made  frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career  i think he probably knows that he is a living joke  i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i d say hes done that
__label__0 now on their sixth studio album  and second on a major label  carbon leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock  pop of  love  loss  hope  repeat   lead vocalist barry privett has a warm  pleasant way of delivering his lyrics  and renowned producer peter collins fulfills his duties  nevertheless  the song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety  in fact  it is so subtle that not one song is memorable  some lyrics are heartfelt   the war was in color  recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson  lead single  learn to fly  regretfully summons up inner strength  but with such flat  bythenumbers melodies these songs have little to stand on  everything sounds just fine  but nothing is endearing  every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance  and privett  despite his appealing voice  could easily be singing one extremely long song  this project is obviously wellintentioned  but many other bands have done this before and better  these guys without a doubt have talent  but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason  next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record
__label__0 this cd was devoid of any of govi s usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work  frankly  it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators  some of the craig chaquicostyle stuff was interesting  but better left to craig  try th heaven  mosaico or guitar odyssey instead
__label__1 i upgraded from the  version with no major problems  the  version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business  the security  however  is not great for a midsized company  since my accountant fully supports the product  they are always available for support
__label__0 this complete waste of  minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lonestar movie  with cringingly awful acting  laughable special effects  the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment   appalling dubbed dialogue  cheesy music  inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere  the grim reaper is a total disaster  do nt waste your money on this turkey
__label__0 i saw this for a good price  i checked for reviews  there were all theese great reviews  whatever  the movie has pretty much no action  the sound video actin is good  but its lonngg and sloowww  there was some good nudity  that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss  ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie  i love falcons  so there you go  i think of it as good enough to keep thats it  maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend  take this as the downside review so all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha
__label__1 after using  for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet  the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous  i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to
__label__1 very topical  easy read  hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening  gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody  looking forward to reading other books by mr bell
__label__0 ca nt add much to the discussion about the movie  but wanted to say that this dvd listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of school daze  it says it has both full screen and widescreen  but it doesnt
__label__0 gary zukav states in his introduction  i had never studied physics  in fact i did nt like science and i had no mathematical aptitude  on opra  tv  he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth  i noticed that some reviewers refer to the  new physics  is that like  new age  or voodoo physics   of the matter must be missing from this book  or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of  he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose  many people say they did not understand physics until this book  surprises  you still do not  you now know what zukav wished physics was  take antimater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater  and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats  at least get it straight before mixing it up  try reading some of these   the ascent of man by jacob bronowski   the book available everywhere the dvd s available from the uk   the upanishads  by eknath easwaran  editor   michael n  nagler  photographer  or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion  then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner   the tao of physics  an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism  by fritjof capra  also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called  what the bleep    both in books and on video
__label__1 this is a good tool  does the job well  and serves the purpose  but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors  forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer  i give a  star because of canon  not because of the product  if you are willing to pay for it  it s a good product
__label__0 patronizing  dreadful  insincere  badly written book  i cut my losses after about four chapters of this fool s memoir  i do nt recommend it
__label__0 we purchased this to make sure we did nt miss anything re  stock options  the program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type  though they were not entered twice  it took me quite sometime to get them deleted  it also said we had to pay estimated tax next yearwhich is nt true since we overpaid  as we have always done   too many errors for a tax program
__label__0 inspiring  no  pleasant  no  entertaining  no  worthwhile  no  what are you folks sniffing out there anyway  whatever it is  please consider passing it along  because other than the single authentic and melodic track by patsy cline  ie  back in baby s arms  which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own   this cd does nt have an ounce of redeeming musical  lyrical or social value in my view  nada  zip  even the dylan track is junk  the entire cd is essentially drivel  put to the dull  homicideprovoking sound of endless  droning noise  with an overall signaltonoise ratio of about one       what a waste of an atod converter
__label__1 joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r  b history  he s always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties  this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles  elton john and gary wright  his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs  but in dts   you are surrounded  as if in concert  by his presence  the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance  imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you ll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album
__label__1 martina mcbride s  emotion  album contains many pop country elements  but is still nonetheless a great album  here s how i rate each song   out of a  star scale    do what you do  good song  but takes a little to get used to    stars    anything s better than feeling the blues  good songs  good lyrics    stars    i love you  great song  martina s most successful song on the country charts  spending  weeks in the top spot    stars    make me believe  great song about whether one s love is true or not  i love the lyric  but it s hard to start a fire without a spark   stars    love s the only house  this song will draw a strong connection to your heart  the song is spectacular and speaks the truth  love is truly the only house big enough for all the world s pain  the video to this song is very touching as well  go martina    stars    there you are  a perfect wedding song  she hold the  are  note for at least  seconds near the end    stars  if you hear this song live  she holds the note  seconds      so live this song will be  stars   stars        it s my time  the first song that i ever heard martina perform live in the ama awards  she rocked the house down with this song  she also holds a  second note at this song  love that range of hers    stars    i ai nt goin  nowhere  i like this song and its message about being there for a significant other    stars    anything and everything  the lyrics and martina s gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection    stars    from the ashes  another standout song on this album  she holds some high notes in this one too    stars    goodbye  a solid performance  i llike how martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song    stars    this uncivil war  the best song on the album     amazing     written by gretchen  the writer of martina s career hit  indepedence day   a very emotional song  which defines the title of the album  the ending is a real treat as well    stars   this album is definitely worth purchasing    it helps complete my collection of martina s albums
__label__0 i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole  and i  too  could nt find it  there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole  except the jewel case which insists it s there  i m so dissapointed i have nt actually tested anything else out  i consider this a very bad start
__label__0 the book from alex haley when i read it some  years ago changed my life and views of people with color  and everyone should read it  yes even conservatives  manditory  however  this movie something just wasnt good  to long  the over all acting  spike  you make some great movies  summer of sam is one of your best  do the right thing  spike has a gift for cinematography  however spike lee interview on espn  the interview said  interviewer   kanye west said that bush does nt care about black people  would you agree with that  lee   yes  i agree with that  but i ll go one step further and say that bush does nt care about people who do nt have any money  whether they re black or white   i guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on long island or let s say the hamptons  you would have had an entirley different response from fema and his administration   but you should have seen how he said it  it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face  the dude is bold man  i ll give him that and i applaude him  spike said either black  white  mexican  or asian  but what he did nt say was italians   that dude has been getting flack forever for his disn of italians in his movies  they call him a racist all the time  here was his chance to say something  and he blew it  just did nt happen to say italians  no so he is a racist too  and so are the africans in africa  they never have liked white people either  so what about that spike  try going over their and applying for a job  and while i am at  the african americans in even baton rouge do nt want the blacks from no coming up their  how come spike never said anything about that  fkn whiners  so many the world over  give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on tv and let the world see it for the fools they are  and ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling da truth
__label__1 i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store  with school and all it s kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight  i ve tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me  no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early
__label__1 the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time  if you re into the whole altcountry thing  you know that some of it is very sincere and serious  ie  uncle tupelo  jayhawks   now i love  no depression   and  blue earth   but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk  or just insurgent country  truth be told  this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant  serious numbers  rico bell s  money to burn   the texas rubies   blue diamond mine   mike ireland s  i d like to    but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously  you ve got andre williams and sally timms singing  i ll stick to you like glue    in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going  gleu  glue   you ve got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other s bodies  you ve got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out  turn the lights down low   which really ought to be a hit it s so catchy  and you ve got some great deadpan covers   the waco brothers do a country raveup of the who s baba oriley   red star belgrade does it to ac  dc s  highway to hell   and best of all  the unholy trio turns public enemy s  bring the noise  into an understated redneck anthem  i m only scratching the surface here  with  tracks over  discs  this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on  and do nt miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation  hellbent  insurgent country  volume ii    see my      review
__label__0 i had this camera for  months  it was kept in a case and was very well taken care of  i would not even allow my husband to touch it  i was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen  i took another and the same thing  i asked my husband what he thought was wrong  we took out our memory card and tried internal  same thing again  he said maybe it was the lcd screen  we loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse  i contacted kodak several times  they do nt care about their customers  i have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results  we will try to get their attention with a lawsuit  if interested contact me
__label__0 first of all  the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles  there are far fewer images than the number touted  this is a scam in my opinion  but a situation i could live with  but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor  actually totally unusable resolution  they have corrupted clarity  poor pixel quality  are distorted  and unsuitable except for perhaps  a third grader s school project  it was a complete waste of money  it is headed for the first garage sale i hold  and i will offer it for  cents with a nonreturn policy
__label__0 i did nt even want to see this movie  but my brother read the book and wanted to see it   we were unaware of the fact that this was nt meant to follow the book   everything was poorly done in this movie  even hans zimmer s score did nt save it  i ve mentioned that i d like it if one could rate an item with negative stars  and if i could  i d give it negative ten
__label__1 this pocket companion serves as a concise overview of the most important facts  amp  concepts from the parent textbook  guyton s textbook of medical physiology   however  it does not contain all the details or some clinical relevances  that s why you have to go back to the parent textbok for furthur info
__label__0 a bunch of junk  not any of the really meaty excersises  an excuse for the auhor to make money
__label__0 i no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder  so i finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until i could get back on my feet to get another good one  i thought this one may do  good price  looks sharp  purchased on impulse   big nono  i will say the camera takes decent pictures  as the previous reviews state  almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with very good lighting   other than that  do nt bother  the mp is a cute function  and quite possibly the most practical   the video  uhh  let s not even go there  the voice recorder  also not bad  records in wav format and can be transferred to pc  jack of all trades  master of none   i guess that would be the best way to finally describe this item  i will say that i ll be saving up now for much better camcorder and no more  i just gotta have this right now  save your   find a quality product  even if you have to pay a little more for it  trust me  it will be overall better in the long run
__label__0 there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website   if there are dust particles floating in the air  they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white  round glare spots  this symptom tends to occur in lowlight environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly  however  this is not a malfunction   read  your lowlight pictures will have spots all over them  sony does not think this is a problem  it is a design flaw  if you are only going to use this camera in full sun  then it is fantastic but seriously  there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job
__label__0 i have loved many of jodi picoult s other books  but this one seemed too farfetched  i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and infact detracted from it  many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release
__label__1 i was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that  it also dried completly by the next time i needed to use it  i would recommend it to anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster  it is not soft and cozy but it does the job
__label__0 after about  months of light use  the camera stopped working  also  the output format was very difficult to work with  absolutely will not work on a mac  the price is coming down greatlyi saw it for  at target
__label__1 pedometer is great  easy to use  accurate  highly recommend it
__label__1 i ca nt say with the words must listen
__label__0 this is not one of the best hair dryers i ve had  at best  it s average  the nozzle is too long  and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal  i like attachments that can rotate so that i can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair  the ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair  after using this hair dryer for  yr and  mths  about x a week   the switch for heat settings is now loose  the dryer only blows cool air even though i slide the switch for higher temperatures  my rating has gone from average to below average
__label__1 i am a two and a half year old boy  i go to a parenttoddler class with my mommy  and my teacher read this story to the class  the pictures captured my interest immediately  the storyline is compelling  but the most fun part is the new vocabulary i ve learned from it  i adore this book and i read it several times a day at home  i memorized the text after my teacher and my parents read it dozens of times for me   i ll never look at a squirrel the same way again
__label__0 think twice before purchase   most of the good tracks are available on the noncopy protected  alltime top  tv themes   along with the best themes from other networks   this disc has cds copy protection  so you probably ca nt upload to windows media and definitely not to itunes  i could not upload from my internal cd drive  only from an external multiformat cd  dvd burner  it still only uploaded to windows media  not itunes  to get into itunes  i had to add the wma files and then convert them to mp this probably caused some quality loss as i m converting one compressed format to another compressed format  a timeconsuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on  controlling  everything  hello record execs  if nobody can add your discs to their libraries  guess what happens  they do nt play your music    you might think you re protecting your valuable investment  but you re shooting yourself in the foot instead  here s how it goes   nobody can upload your music   nobody plays your music   nobody hears your music   nobody recommends your music   nobody buys your music  remember  this only loaded from a particular kind of drive  so it may or may not work on yours  as bela lugosi would say  bevare

__label__0 michael moore filmed this propaganda  partially financed by the united auto workers  to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants  the japanese auto invasion  made possible by gm s unhealthy cost structure  the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages  something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal  so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings  years of losses at gm have shown moore s twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then  phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers  moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball  but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff  let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain  all of gm s problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross  slow redesign cycles  lack of money for research  you name it  moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past  years and how now that consumers have a choice  they find the better value in asian autos  nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor  the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough  enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a  documentary
__label__1 and finding stories of stacks of old vinyls  dripping yesterday and glowing always  cali s finest  madlib  is definitely one of the heirs of dj premiere  pete rock  dj quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hiphop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated  the latest madlib invasion is not for everybody  those of us who s butts were undeniably moved by tribe s  low end theory  will definitely appreciate this endeavor  those of you who are tired of what mtv and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop  clean out your crazy uncle otis s attic check out the beat konducta  then walk down the street to mr yancey s house  go into his basement and check out j dilla s  donuts
__label__1 this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie  it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere  once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since do nt look now back in   this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out  alongside white noise  as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense
__label__1 this is a very good product  it helps prolong the life of the electric razor
__label__1 this is the perfect camera for me  i take alot of closeup detail shots and the images come out great  it is smaller than my old g  which i loved  but was pretty chunky
__label__1 this book was amazing  i m giving it to my dad for helping me through college  great gift for parents and children
__label__0 the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style  it makes my arm and finger tired
__label__0 this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base  not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else  it does not include a docking station  you have to shell out more money for that option  i dont think so
__label__1 i m very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble  story line shmory line  this is an action movie  i watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion  kind of a heartbreaking movie  though  because he s dead no matter what  the man ca nt sleep or he slips in a coma  going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her  that s a film  you wo nt regret owning this  i promise you  ps it is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies  that is all
__label__0 hmm  ok  maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd  but i heard one of the songs on it  hashkiveynu  performed  partially  during an episode of the west wing  and it sounded amazing  it was not the same cantor as on this cd   i am not jewish and not even very spiritual  but i wanted to have that song in my collection  i immediately searched the web for the info  got the name of the chant and found this cd  i almost purchased it without listening  when i found a different site  where they actually have rather long excerpts   min   of most tracks  so i listened to them  boy  was i relieved and disappointed at once  relieved that i did nt buy the cd and disappointed that i could nt get the song i wanted  i was willing to buy a whole cd for just  song  that s how much it impressed me   the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing  although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show  and i m sorry to say it but the voice also does nt hold a candle to the one used on the show  way too  operatic   as mentioned by many  and harsh and even unpleasantsounding to me  it took all the charm and candor right out of the song  in the show  they had a much more natural voice do the song   i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist  if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer  if it can be the one from the west wing  i ll be thrilled   please  let me know  in the meantime  i m passing on this cd
__label__0 not even worth finishing this book  this author does not know enough to even write this book  i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be  it is a one sided story not based on facts  which it what most writers do  but purely fiction  the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on  not the postive stories that i hear about everyday  do nt waste your money
__label__1 the casting here was excellent  ben stiller  elle macpherson  sarah jessica parker were all great  in fact  i am convinced that elle macpherson can act because of the  movies i have now seen her in  she plays decidedly different people in each one  she is perfectly cast as joe s dream woman  i found eric schaeffer s character the least appealing of the whole cast  some of the jokes here are wildly funny  the audience is never given a clue that the jane lindquist character is only getting involved with joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her  i thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually  but was not interested in a relationship with him  earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships  people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants  that part did not make sense  this could have been improved by some better writing and better character development  the humor here is what makes this worth watching

__label__0 i visit england frequently  i have an earlier edition of this book which i find to be very useful  even now  the new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility  i have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an english pint is  ounces  anyone who is serious about english beer knows that an english pint is  ounces
__label__1 i get the sense that the fleetwoodsbody of recorded work is nt given the respect it deserves  over the course of their career  the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection  as good as it is  is pretty much all that s out there on cd  save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground  rock and roll has always had a soft side and it s in this area that the fleetwoods really shine  their cover of thomas wayne s  quot  tragedyquot  is an evocative slice of  teen angsti ca nt put it any other way  maybe that s the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today  they re the perfect embodiment of a  then  nascent teen culture s soft and gentle sidethis collection features all of their hits  some well chosen album tracks and the original preoverdub version of  quot  come softly to mequot   if you like this recording  try looking for their original lps   my personal favourite is the   quot  goodnight my lovequot  album
__label__0 this movie creeped me out and not in a good way  johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross  maybe it s the michael jacksonish look he has going on with the black wig and white face  could they have picked a more horrible look for ww  it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a  wig and  clown makup on him  i love tim burton s other movies but this one sucked bigtime  it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from  this movie is childish if you re an adult and pales compared to the original  if you re a kid it s way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking  auntie zoe  what does that mean   when are screenwriters going to figure it out  either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie    it s really hard to do both in the same film  it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids  they end up appealing to nobody  maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version  i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing  it s amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters  the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones  the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is because i love depp and burton  if you are not a fan of either  do nt waste your time with this steaming pile of poo
__label__0 i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase  so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled  when i read  chocolate pecan pie   i expected just that  the taste of rich chocolate  with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base  what i received was a bar with little taste  nothing at all similar to the name on the bar  in my opinion  the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it  the flavor is barely there  the bar is dry  it is never again be on my  purchase  list

__label__1 i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings  keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results  the size of the cuff is very important  so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results  this is true in the doctors office also  my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office  on his machine  just by changing the size of the cuff  this is an excellent monitor  i could nt be happier with it  it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too
__label__1 this book does a fine job explaining the facts of biblical archaeology  the latest discoveries are listed which makes it a solid addition to the book  quot  the bible as history  quot
__label__1 for those who endeavor to perfect fine art digital printmaking  this is the book to read  it is a  quot  how toquot  and so much more  the book covers paper  ink  techniques  hand coloring and the practical application and intereaction of all of these variables  the book is cogently written and elegantly displayed  it is a must for anyone s library who wishes to expand their horizons in the digital printing arena  ms airey is a master of her craft and it shows
__label__0 saw the knockoff series  jeremiah  when it was the classic star trek episode  miri   in which all the adults past puberty were killed by a virus originally meant to prolong life  also saw it as the canadian tv series  the tribe   in which all the adults are killed by some sort of plague  also read it in  the kindling   by jennifer armstrong  a novel in which teenagers must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their memories and kills all adults  i laughed when the amazon reviewer called the premise of  jeremiah   intriguing   well  the other works do nt have luke perry or pretty f  x  maybe that s the  intriguing  part of this latest adaptation of one of the most overused themes in science fiction
__label__1 i do nt know what other people are complaining about  i just installed vista ultimate a few days ago and i absolutely love it  no interface lag or any other lag at all  maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware  those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it  i m glad microsoft is nt waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge  i d rather be the one catching up than the other way around  i have a core  duo e overclocked to ghz   gigs of ram  a geforce gt and a western digital raptor x g hd and vista ultimate works flawlessly on my computer  it s not the best computer but it runs flawlessly  i built it myself and all the parts cost me about  off the net  i play world of warcraft among some other games and i have nt seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software i use as of yet  i ve only encountered one problem and that was with my old soundblaster live   sound card which has discontinued support  no big deal  it was about time to get a better one anyway
__label__0 the night owl optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as i started using it  the system uses high voltage derived from aa bateries  occationally the unit would create a large snap  arcing noise  and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece  if one is using the instrument  the light actually hurts the eye  i have returned the monocular to night owl for repairs  i do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit  they told me to ship it at my expense  another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for  hours  other than the above  the monocular has performed well  epiloguenight owl optics did repair the unit and returned it
__label__0 i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here  who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper s  the dark is rising  is plain awful  this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read  i must say it was a waste of my time to read  dark   never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero  in this case  we are told that on his th birthday  an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of  the old ones   unlike jk rowling who  in the first pages of harry potter  the philosopher s  or sorcerer s  stone  provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny  with an unruly mop of black hair  startlingly green eyes  and  of course  a lightningbolt scar on his forehead  cooper does not describe will stanton at all  the result is that the reader  after having read  pages  still cannot visualize what will looks like   i also find quite annoying cooper s approach to this good vs evil tale  she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones  and who or what exactly is the dark  as for the dark being evil  all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold  snow  and of course darkness  excuse me  but is this the best cooper can do  is this what this book is about   the druid pagan worldview of light vs dark  summer vs winter  warmth vs cold  what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil
__label__1 i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book  however when i initially started ochem  i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook  so i suggest  to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry  the text isnt an  advanced  textbook perse  after a good grounding in the basics for three days  i found this book quite user friendly   its organization is completely different to most other ochem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic  both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity  an examples is that when introducing orbitals  and orbital interaction  greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding  wade and mcmurry leave this  one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later  a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals  lone pairs and charge  these are the things used to identify em  as such  the book isnt fragmented  each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry  chapters are well referenced so if  say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding  most textbooks act like a stupid monologue  miss a passage and you d completely miss organic chem  the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant  it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept  ie jacobs   however  the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry  principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge  organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors  for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry  i would suggest you look elsewhere  a substitute  a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry  is hornback s which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry

__label__0 so this was my first digital camera  got it last july for my birthday  i go to a lot of concerts  so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects  well  two days after i got it  i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white  it would still take pics  only you couldnt see them  after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on  it went back to normal  alarmed  i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again  it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again  but that was only one thing wrong with it  this is a horrible camera for concerts  the pictures are always blurry  shoot  even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes  tuesday i went to see my fav band again  and the dumb thing goes white  it woudnt stop  no matter how many times i turned it off and on again  now the flash is broke and i m ready to throw it against the wall  you ca nt trust this camera  you never know when it will take good pics or bad picsi wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute
__label__0 as you might think  i am not a die hard fan of jmj  i think that when only die hard fans rates an album  it makes you think that with such a high rating  everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth  not everybody like this king of musical experimentation  some do but some dont i like oxygene and equinoxe  and even after all those years  they are still good to listen too  rendez vous offers some really good moments  but we are far from the perfection as oxygene or equinoxe  rendezvous is easier to get use to that zoolook is  but we are far from a near perfect album  that s all
__label__1 although the compartments seem small  you can fit lots of food into this bowl  it s divided into about  or  sections  so you can separate your veggies  meat  etc the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack  the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break   so  i use it to store food in the fridge  i have all of the other fit  fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken
__label__0 bad  bad  bad  bad acting  bad writing  bad directing  i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting  consequently  since seeing this  i have nt voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance  it was a huge mistake by the director  or the screen writer  to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up  or if it was meant to be  it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms
__label__0 i thought it was me until i read several other reviews of predator  ms cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess  if she s going to continue the scarpetta series  she needs to get back on track  creating characters that we care about  i finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me  what a disappointment
__label__1 this documentary on the life of louis armstrong  one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music  is a quick look at how louis armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist  trumpeter  band leader  and arranger   louis armstrong  satchmo  starts with louis s life growing up in new orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band  which is where his skill had room to take off  the documentary follows his move to chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings  the dvd contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks louis armstrong s gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname  satchmo   louis  with his love for performing  became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies  the docubiography reveals how louis never lost his lovable  downtoearth manner  even with the increased size of his audience  louis was just louis  and he would always be loved for his smile  his lovable personality  and of course his music  containing interviews with tony bennett and wynton marsalis   louis armstrong  satchmo  is a pleaser about a jazz player s rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer  and he never lost his charm  we love you  louie
__label__1 i was referred to this book by my midwife  debra oconner  as a book that i had to read as it s content was so  quot  right onquot  and was she ever right  i know alot about my body  i am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a  year old that i had at home  i spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process  that was great knowledge to add to the physiology i learned during my massage training  this book though  is something that every woman in our culture today should read  i now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken  i hope to give this to everyone i know who has a daughter  i hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right  our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message  it is women s reality and needs to be shared  of course it is written by a midwife  thank you elizabeth
__label__0 ok  i know i m going to get hammered for this  once again  there goes my reviewer rating  but i just have to be honest  this is a terrible story  ok  being that it s shakespeare  it s prettily told  but it s still a horrible story  and i ca nt imagine why otherwise sensible people like it  perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongueincheek  it is a comedy  after all  and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not  that would almost make it tolerable  if i could believe it  but given that it is a shakespearean comedy  we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a  happy  one  and the situation at the end is far from pleasant  or perhaps people believe  i ve heard this claimed in all seriousness  that kate has actually  triumphed  at the end  having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly  even if this were true  i d hardly consider it a  happy  anding  and personally  i see little evidence of it  no  what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman  some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it  being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who  tames  her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse  he does nt beat her  simply starves her and sleepdeprives her  as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants  up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives  her spirit may or may not be broken  depending on how the part is played  but the fact remains that she s forced to behave as if it is  and that s not a message that should be bruited about in a  comedy   this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare s plays
__label__1 what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd have nt already said  arthur is outrageously talented  it s almost shocking  the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense  it s extremely well recorded and mixed music  anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now   stumble and pain  is probably my favourite track  the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb  as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense  layered  and its something he s obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album  anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption s son straight after that  what a musician
__label__0 in the classic and disturbing  movie deliverance  lewis  burt reynolds  gives this ominous warning to ed  jon voigt    machines are going to fail  systems are going to fail  then  survival   what  i wonder  will richard d  james  aka aphex twin  aka afx  do when the machines fail  it s been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs  where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question  the plaintive  lovely  satieesque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract  frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration  another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica  alarm will sound performs aphex twin chosen lords  rdj s first proper cd release since then  is actually a collection of various tracks from his  analord series  of overpriced  elaborately packaged inch vinyl singles that he s been cranking out over the last year or so  those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled  drummachine laden compositions as a  return to greatness   indeed  afx is certainly reviving a more compact  accessible  for him   and straightforward style here  with comparatively regular  though not quite danceable  rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies  i have to say  though  that there s a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels  by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way  without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy  windowlicker  the richard d  james album  and  yes   drukqs  notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions   true  they were usually rather unsettling  distorted  and manipulated voices  but at least they added some welcome humanity  also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose  ballads   such as  flim    nannou  and the striking piano interludes on drukqs  in the end  chosen lords  while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music  is nonetheless a sterile  static  joyless affair  if it inspires any emotion at all  it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career  yes  i m afraid the machines have failed richard d  james  and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation

__label__1 the subject provided a good historical perspective on japan s renaissance period  post civil wars and prewesternization  in many respects musashi  a ronin represents japan s search for an identity  a country ruled by military might in the form of the shogun  yet keeping an emperor who they revered as a god  a god without power  this sword saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel  he was also an artist  a lithographer and an author  yet  he was masterless  masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer s devotion to his master  he was his own master  in a time when japan had no voice  serving all  without righteous  it would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the samurai  that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of miyamoto musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession  master of the sword

__label__0 i am a  yr old mother of a     yr old  not only are these children horrible singers  but there is a reason that most parents do nt let their children listen to the original songs  they teach them things they do nt need to know  i thought this would be a  kids  version that would get rid of that stuff when i let a child i was babysitting put the cd on  and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children  they did nt take that out  children are exposed to that every day in our world now  telling them it is  normal  and  ok   parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today  it becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for  kids  that teaches them that those things are  normal   they assume if it is ok for a kids cd  it ca nt be that bad  i think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child  some of the songs i like in the originial version and do listen to  and this cd has ruined them  but when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and does nt mean what they say is ok  i think it is the worst thing you could buy for your child
__label__1 this film came out in  and i saw it in its original full length version  about hours and  min   executives from columbia pictures were there  it was the premeire  and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out  verbal  and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums  the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free  we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon  the miscasting  the terrible sets  the odd ball music for the story  the dubbed liv ullmann  the dance routines of olivia husseyall of it  you cannot find a musical like it  or a soundtrack like it  columbia execs were unimaginative  they should have believed in this film  the next day after this premeire in boston  new york etc  simultaneous i suppose  the film was cut  the posters were taken downthere was a ton of material to buyt shirts  dolls  posters of all sizes  bath towels with the poster on them  records of the sd tk of course  and small pop up sets of the entire film  it was to be a massive hitin two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed  and the posters said  last two weeks  and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared  but many people came to see itlines of people  and  when they heard it had been cut  they gave up  and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film  i have many treasures from that opening nite  and now i have the cd of the sound track  anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film  it is unique  enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd they are out there

__label__1 this film seems to be known worldwide as a  chick flick   from the romantic aspects of it  to the current anniversary dvd s pink cover  i m an  year old guy who absolutely digs this film  especially due to the holly golightly character  after viewing this film for the first time  i developed a crush on the character holly  kind of goofy  i guess  but it s very hard for me to dislike a character like her   audrey hepburn played her to perfection  the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards  i love the film s dialogue as well  it has a very realistic quality  and it s so fun to hear the characters converse with each other   breakfast at tiffany s  is perhaps the best  date  movie ever conceived  this film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age

__label__1 this is one of the great biopic films ever made  more often than not  film biopics are too rushed  they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives  and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives  this is not one of those films  it just covers woody guthrie s adult life  from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer  and his passionate defense of the working man  the look of the film is deliberate  in that it s washed out  the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film  they re really lively  where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves  the film has a real genuine feel to it  like you re actually watching real people  david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie  he makes you think you re actually watching woody himself  he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film  ronny cox is excellent as well  and he does his own singing too  remember  cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance   randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well  this is a fabulous film  and it feels short at     hours
__label__1 the bbc created the perfect cast in this terrific film  watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today  it is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets  the latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the bbc version  highly recommend to those who love jane austin and her works
__label__0 the me provides a modest x magnification for viewfinders on olympus s e and e cameras  ideally  this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing  unfortunately  this did not happen when i used the me to make a number of trial images with my e  so i will be returning the me for a refund   for the record  i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting  with my  shooting eye  corrected to    vision   like other folks  i find the e viewfinder a trifle small so that it s not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time  the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing  which is not always comfortable  in some ways  the me created more problems than it solved  the me kept the camera further from my face  though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses   but at the cost of narrowing my angle of vision in the viewfinder  divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares  the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible  but those along the sides  top  and bottom were less visible than before  the corners considerably less  to frame a shot  i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me than without it  to see exposure data  i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image  more hassle than i need when shooting in the field  fortunately  there is another option that works for me  the e and e come with an ep eyecup  which is definitely too small for my taste  but a larger eyecup is also available  the ep the ep keeps the camera a little further from my face  and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted  a critical step no one seems to mention   the ep allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all  all of this will vary from person to person  of course  and there may be circumstances when the me is exactly what s needed   so two rather than one star  but not in standard shooting conditions  especially if you need to compose  set exposure  and shoot quickly
__label__1 excellent book  if you are interest in ancient egypt  read this book  you ll learn a lot of interesting facts about the valley of the kings  the pharaohs  etc
__label__1 terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger  it covers approximately  years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma  they have their differences  yet the love between them is always so obvious  it s also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other  even their sex lives  i ve seen this movie several times  and everytime i cry at the end  in spite of the death  the movie ends on a positive note  giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay  the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor  also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson  creates a plotwithinaplot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children  the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her  when she has been cheating on him as well  somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover  played by the very talented john lithgow   we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship does nt seem wrong  if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gutwrenching at the same time  this is a perfect choice
__label__0 like many of the reviewers here  i am an anne rice fan  however  i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them  i mean  few of the  dracula  movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker s novel  all i wanted  and expected  was a flashy  no substance guilty pleasure movie  a la  dracula   that alone should tell you my expectations  but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure  the storyline did nt make a lot of sense when taken on it s own  and the acting was bad to bland  i also take issue with the badlydone look of the vampires  rice s vampires are supposed to be beautiful  whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house  however  one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat  since the videos are included on the dvd  it earns  star
__label__1 i like the features the same as i did with cool edit  i have nt had the opportunty to explore all the new features  but it looks promising
__label__0 this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch  the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama  my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i was nt in the mood she forced me to watch this  the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet  this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand  overall the film was just ok i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again  if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did

__label__1 seventeenyearold catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things  dancing  dressing  and reading sensational novels  but doing these things wo nt get you a husband  or acquaint you with other young ladies  such as yourself  so  upon request from a neighbor  catherine is invited to spend some time in bath  a fashionable town  where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature  who are not related to her  and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family  quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe  catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious  yet conniving family  and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney  along with his charming sister  eleanor  and whisked off to their ancestral home  known only as northanger abbey  there  catherine s choice of reading material  mysteries and ghost stories  that is  comes back to haunt her  for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night  such as creaking  and frightening winds  that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself  the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors  and a curious history only heightens young catherine s suspicions  and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey  and the tilney family  in general  jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young  but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore  and decided to purchase it  i will admit that  hands down  this has become one of my favorite austen books  catherine is an enchanting character  whose innocence  and naivete make her charming from beginning to end  while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers  catherine s interactions with isabella thorpe  and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid  and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters  while the charming henry tilney  like mr darcy  makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman  and our young heroine  a wonderful  satirical piece of fiction  that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan  erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape

__label__1 i found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutiquecom  the length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer  i decided to try this product to see if it worked  as hair growth is normally clocked at an    of an inch per month  i decided to monitor the results in my own little  clinical test   this was actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i d easily be able to see how much growth there was each month  i ordered a box of viviscal for which i paid  for  average price on the web  and the was set to take the first pill the following morning  the box recommends  per day   i coloured my hair the night before so that in one month i d be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring  results  i did nt really notice anything until around the  week time frame  i noticed my nails were growing very fast  very long  i have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all  it was very noticeable because i use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard  never having great nails  i was pretty happy to see this  my curiosity was also getting the better of me as i could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at  weeks after coloring  i took the tape measure and measured almost    of an inch in hair growth  this would mean    inch per month and  inches per year  i was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small  it was twice the rate my hair normally grows  but i also noticed something else  my hair was becoming unusually greasy  because i have very dry hair  i normally only wash it  times a week  but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal  hmmm well  at the  month time frame i measured my hair growth and it was exactly    of an inch  not only that but i was constantly trimming my nails at this point  i was totally ecstatic  but also by this point  i was washing my hair every day  it was no longer dry and brittle  it was much softer  but there was no way i could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy  so  the conclusions i have reached from my test was this   yes  viviscal works  it caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed   viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster   viviscal makes your hair greasy  causing you to have to wash it every day  and then it s fine  it did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else  which i thought a bit strange  though good      i recommend this product

__label__1 these are all short stories  some very short  that s what he wrote  i remember reading a number of these  the science fiction ones mostly  in translation years ago  rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting  as a collection of all his fictions  some of the items are a bit repetitive  the variations on the  knife fight  theme for instance  but the range of his imagination is fascinating  particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity  a lot of it presages the informationbased world of today  which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind  perhaps the link to the internet is one reason borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles  is not the web exactly borges   book of sand   a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information  but when we turn to find them again  we never can  and how long will it be before an imagined  orbis tertius  engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on  one might suggest it s already happened  look up tatooine  for instance   what exactly is information when it s just a bunch of ones and zeros  everything s already been written in the  library of babel  after all  the other fascinating thread to me was the influence of arabic and muslim themes  i d never caught that before  but this collection includes a number of stories with an arab perspective  perhaps this is a wellknown part of spanish heritage  in any case  it was certainly interesting getting to know borges through this collection  from the knife fights to the arabian courts to the immortals  not everything was great  but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with

__label__1 this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape  grounded firmly in love and faithfulness  it moves quickly  i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant  the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that s understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu  and it is not transient but deepens  miriam  abu s sister  remains with me in her moving quietude  and the litle girl lela  hand in hand with julie  plucks deep
__label__1 for an allpurpose color film  i nearly always shoot fuji s  speed  it has the cooler tones that i prefer in my images and a good saturation level  the only drawback that i ve seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way overpriced  the only place that i ve seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets  any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less  and you wo nt have to wait for it to ship
__label__0 i had never read any of vernor vinges books before  but i had heard he was an excellent author  so i thought i would try this  boy  am i glad i bought it used on amazon for about only  i simply had no idea what was going on in this novel  the plot is unintelligible  i dont know what the bioweapon the jacket refers to is  i dont know what  the rabbit  is  i see that numerous other reviews here  did not know what was going on either  i do not understand how someone could write so incoherently  the concept of someone who had alzheimers getting cured  entering a future society is great  but it never goes anywhere  the only reason i did not fall asleep  was that i was trying to figure out what was going on  but i did could not even finish this book

__label__0 i wish i could give this movie zero stars  it s really amazing how someone can inject raw gore  violence  and sick humour into a movie  and try to pass it off as slick comedy  drama  and deep philosophy  this movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie  the sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism  do yourself a favour and please do nt ever watch this movie if it comes on air  it s not even worth watching for morbid fascination  i terribly resent the fact that i gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity  but then  i may actually be glad that i did  at least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be
__label__1 this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book  it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan  well written and historically accurate  it s obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture  customs  history and life style of japan  this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story  for all who ve ever lived in japan  it s a believable tale that literally makes you feel you ve stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan  for those who have nt lived in japan  believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind  because of this  he s able to focus on his character versus scene  setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind  the timespan covers over  years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations  and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life  a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her  when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue  but even good books must end  be prepared to sit a spell  once you start reading you ll find it hard to put down

__label__1 i would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around  and charging  two separate gadgets  it takes excellent pictures  just as good if not better than any other digital camera i have seen  i am also very pleased with the video  i found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer  the battery has a good life  i have had no problems having to stop and recharge it  there is a nite mode that compensates  very well  i think  for low light video  the camera is easy to carry around  it is smaller than my mm  and i am having no problems with the functionality  all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video

__label__1 great product  the girls had a blast with it  real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair  great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled  although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair  not all the time though  still a fabulous product  would highly recommend it  my niece wishes it came with more gems

__label__0 just listening to the samples of this new remix of  goldth anniversary edition  the carpenters  i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly  certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well  i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs  as another review noticed and i agree with  is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen s deep resounding truly perfect voice  this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters  the older cds  if still in production or if you can find them used   carpenters classics th anniversary  a  cd disc  minute collection remastered digitally  is a much better pick  especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with  the other cd s worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen s deep resounding perfect voice  would be the cd  voice of the heart  this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song  the other one i would highly recommend  if christmas is your holiday  would be  carpenters christmas portrait    special edition digital versioncelebrating  continuious minutes of the seasons best   with karen and richard  there are  carpenters songs as timeless as their sound  and  performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time  these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing  these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard  this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter s recorded and later remasterednot remixed  sounded  for this reason i give this th anniversary remix a  star rating  these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans  took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song  talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver  as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying  if it ai nt broke do nt fix it   or in this case do nt remix it

__label__0 as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating  and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled  drawing people  a technical guide for beginners  and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure  then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery  instead of a full out disappointment  not that i blame the author solely  most of the blame lies at my door  i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure  brune hogath s book aside  another devastating disappointment   and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art  a school that i am still deciding on attending  that instead of going my normal route  ordering the book through the store  checking it out in person  and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount  i impulsively bought the book  only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews  which all looked favorable   now i realise my folly  and am yet determining whether i ll pay for it  ie keep the book   i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality  for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience  and i d say that experience shows equally in all areas  not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through  the problem is  at least in my opinion  that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing  and it does nt for the most part  roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing  the other three fourths talk about  how to properly hold your drawing implement  how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle  maintaing a daily sketchbook  researching your subject matter  the relationships between the head neck and shoulders  drawing hands  drawing feet  drawing eyes  and a whole slew of other   i would nt say irrelavent  because they are relavent  but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure  a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials  and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing  it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips  again something bradley discusses on one single page  the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing  she did nt bother mentioning that  how pants typically bunch up while you re walking seen from the head on  profile  three quaters  and back view  another topic she failed to mention  some examples of evening  formal attire vs day clothes  how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion  how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up  the effect of wearing multiple layers at once  achieving that perfect windswept look  and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide  maybe i m being too harsh on bradley  after all she does mention in her preface that there are nt a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure  and compared to the standard  how to     books she s leaps and bounds ahead of the rest  oh yeah  that s another thing  she does nt outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like  first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom  base  the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere  note the ripples  or some junk like that  back to me not being to harsh on bradley  i guess in reading she is  was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing  for all who have read this drawn out rant  two maybe three people  and think i m all talk  trust me if i had the skills i d come up with my own series of  how to draw     books and address all of my issues  as is i m pretty good at drawing dynamic figures  but the second i add clothing they become flat  lifeless caricatures and i do nt see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much  as is my own artistic habits  drawing from magazines  online pics  and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion  are a match for the few helpful hints in this book  you re better off doing what you ve always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book  if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics  if you could write a review mentioning them  somehow recommend them to me or whatever i d be eternally in your debt
__label__0 apart from the great selection of soundtracks  what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing  executed with finesse  these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited  fuller versions  like  singing in the rain   for example  throw in the great price  and this double disc set is a  must have  for all lovers of classic movie music
__label__1 having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band  while the singer  conor oberst  does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands  he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout  unlike a band like taking back sunday  the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental  the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punkpolitics band and do nt come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit  if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes  if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos

__label__0 dark tort  was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read  but for a novel that s supposed to be part of a quirky  light mystery series  i found things a bit leaden  the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered  and when we finally do move beyond that scene  a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further  i do admit that it also does nt help that i m one of those people who ca nt suspend disbelief and have to ask   so she s an offsite caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified   but  that s just me  oh  well  many of the recipes did sound good  though i doubt i ll get around to making any of them  this is one of those reviews where it s probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series  which i personally have nt read but suspect are nt much different than this one   you ll likely enjoy this installment  too  the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b  parker  spenser  novel for our light mystery fix

__label__0 the last american virgin  was literally one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  and that s saying a lot  it s not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom  the writing was terrible  the acting was terrible  the direction was terrible  the pacing was terrible  the jokes were godawful  etc even the girls were nt really that attractive  with the huge  s hair and bad fashion   i mean  what the hell was that fat  ugly  dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie  and  even more perplexing  why was our  hero  trying to lay her   and why was our  hero  best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with  they would be at each other s throats in one scene and then best friends in the next  i would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack  but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again  i guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs  they played  whip it  twice   shake it up  at least three times  and  at last count   just once  like five times  when  once  was certainly enough  songs that i did nt know at the beginning of the movie i knew by heart word for word by the end  to top it all off  this movie had one of the worst  most disastrous endings i ve ever seen  i can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt  comingofage drama  but when you re doing a mindless  teensex comedy  you do nt end on a downer and depress the audience  after all the hell our  hero  goes through  he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin  and then  without any followup or warning  the credits start rolling  i was like   what the hell   the only great thing about the movie is that i had a ball paying  mstk   only no one was around to appreciate my witty  sardonic remarks  so i ll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure  on arguing with your  best friend  over the  love of your life    hey  i stalked her first   on sparking up a romance with said girl   remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile  did nt that mean anything to you    on declaring your love for said girl   i ve loved you ever since i destroyed your bike just so you d talk to me   on major operations   not that big a deal   real line  referring to the girl s upcoming abortion    hey  it happens all the time  it s not that big a deal   my line   yeah  it s a simple coat hanger procedure    and later  real line   i know dozens of girls who ve done it   my line   i ve helped all the gals in the neighborhood  they call me dr abortion   on nerds at parties   man  there s nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw  aww  yeah    on fat girls  inconsistent characterizations of  real line   you know i have to be home by a quarter to     a minute later   you said you had drugs  where are they   my line   i have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me  so fuk me in the a and let s do some blow before they come home   on choose your mate carefully   as our  heroes  scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous  older woman   nothing s funnier than getting gonorrhea  eh folks    skip this dreck and rent  fast times at ridgemont high  instead  at least that one had phoebe cates

__label__0 this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen yearold who aspires to be a mass murderer  there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property  even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino s  kill bill  films  his salute to the genre  or  reservoir dogs   which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence   bullet   is little more than two hours of broken glass  fire  blood squirts  amputation  beatings and explosions  this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic  the characters are totally flat  onedimensional  there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc  the acting is weak  static  despite the fact that i do nt understand a word of cantonese  we are presented with a series of stereotypes  the hooker with a heart of gold  the good friend  the crazy friend and the bad friend   unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen   and saigon as hopelessly corrupt   is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation  the worst thing is that   because they are so shallow and undeveloped   you do nt care what happens to the characters  so i ll tell you and then you wo nt have to finish watching the film  they kill each other  my advice  skip it

__label__1 i am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses  or mood  the authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs  which they say may be causing depression  you are free to choose the approach that works best for you  but you do need to try them all to see what works  it is quite time consuming  one of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour  the instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful  however it does take a true commitment  i suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work

__label__1 first of all i would like to say that i was very reluctant to buy a sony camera  after doing a lot of research for my needs i ended up with canon is and sony s new toy t ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but i wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs  sony t is the best looking camera i have seen  it s features are awesome compared to it s small size  you can take it everywhere  big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight  it takes good indoor pictures too  i tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good  but then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me  the auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything  sometimes changing auto iso helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes  which would be  of the time atleast for me  it wo nt make difference  just point and shoot  you get a perfect image for viewing on computers  no complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about  x optical zoom is boon to me as x was merely zoom  also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with x fps shooting  it does nt have touch screen like t and so it s responsiveness is better  i would like it bit faster though  also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than  secs  i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it
__label__0 let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my coworkers in regards to movies to watch  at least when it comes to the horror genre  numerous people where i work told me that this movie   the descent  was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made  in their defense  my coworkers were nt the only people with this opinion  many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing  well  apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to  because i was sorely disappointed  but more on that later  for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular   the descent   the descent  begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends  when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident  one year later at the prodding of those same friends  she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure  the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave  in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet  so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave  making matters worse  this cave is not like any ordinary cave  for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal  at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story  and the shocking opener really caught my attention  giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected  however  once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave  which is actually where the majority of the film takes place  things begin to go awry for the picture  at first  the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere  giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom  then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie  this is a cave that no one has been in  and these girls are hardly professional  so  who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave  it s absolutely stupid  especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other  none of these girls would do this to each other  after this occurs the mutants show up  a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction  however  this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster  because it s now just one gory scene after another  and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie  a decision i somewhat agreed with  yet still did nt agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown  on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls  you just assume they re cannibalistic  but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there  even though  the descent  was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time  by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers  to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity   the descent  is unrated and contains violence and language
__label__0 i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one  it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me  as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery  i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it  something more enigmatic  a brilliant twist but i was left with despair  my major problem with this novel was there were not enough  in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer  and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities  i will never touch this author s book again  a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the bestdan brown

__label__1 for more than a year now  i have been using adaware  i love it  the program scans for spyware  adware  hijackers  keyloggers  and common trojans  but norton is the one that takes out the trojans   so far  i am happy with this product  even though i have never had anything bad on my computer  just cookiesmmm  cookies   my friend sure has had his share with minibug  axela  ezula  funwebproducts  and some others  and adaware completely removes it  and it does it all for free  yes  you can get the personal version free at lavasoft s website   so what s something that adaware personal does nt do  realtime  you ll notice on the personal version that if you click on adwatch to enable realtime  it will state  realtime protection not avaliable in the personal edition    so  i checked out the plus edition  so  i did a test on an old computer  and installed ezula  that s right  it did nt go through  right when it reached  an adaware popup stated  ezula was found at c    whatever   would you like to remove    wow  amazing  one thing that is does nt do is block most popups  this is dissappointing  mainly because competetors like superadblocker  superantispyware has a great popup blocker along with everything adaware has  but  superadblocker does nt have realtime  and adaware does  i d recommend getting both  for now  if the computer is in a school  hotel  or airport of such  getting the plus edition would nt be a bad idea  but if you just use it for home  just keep the free personal edition  there are nt that many spyware programs that do things virus do  but i have seen some that restart computers and add odd programs  such things trojans do  though  for now  if you re not using this for public use  just have adaware personal se  if this is for public use  this is a great idea  and you may also want to get superadblocker for extra spyware protection and an excellent advertisement blocker  hell  now that i think of it  even if you have adware and superadblocker  it will block the adware   and norton or mcafee for viruses or trojans  actally  every computer needs norton or mcafee  unless it s a mac or something   as for adaware  it s an excellent program  and it s highly recommended  maybe in feature editions  maybe well see a popup  banner  flash blocker that superadblocker  superantispyware has
__label__0 i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling  while reh was first and foremost a story teller  pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather s remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades  this  as previous reviewers have mentioned  creates a large gap between reader and story  but why do this  why use such a crappy method of story telling  i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue  all in all  it s a slow  uninspired  day dream story  so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews  i want my money back
__label__0 i agree with other reviewers  do nt waste your money  i should have listened to the samples  to hear more awful fakes  visit the producer s web site at drewsfamouscom  listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase
__label__1 the oral b eb dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places  reaching back teeth  removing plaque  has a nice gum massage action  and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed  the two heads work twice as good as one  but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head  using it by gently guiding it over your teeth  and letting it do all the work  it will last a long time too  it was nearly three months before i had to replace mine  most oral b brushes are interchangeable with all oral b units  this one though  according to the buying info here  may not be used with the cross action brush  it will also indicate when it s time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles   the box shows as good picture of new and used   just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too  it s a  star product  but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out  the better buy would be to purchase the three pack  it s almost like getting one free  my pack also came with different color rings  that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart  it s nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well  keep smilinglaurie
__label__0 hi  i bought this camera and installed the driver from both the cd and then the web  it caused my computer  a good  modern  fast computer  to crash both times  the camera worked without interfacing with the computer  but  then  what s the point  also  the pictures and movies were very grainy and low quality  the tech support when i had these problems was horrible  they really did nt stand behind the product at all and to me that s the most important thing  maybe i could have gotten it to work  but not without some input from aiptek  i ve never written one of these reviews before  but this really got to me  do nt buy this camera is my advice
__label__1 this bag is great for your slr digtial camera  it has space for your extra lens  everything that came with you slr camera fits in this bag  this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive
__label__1 this is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points  the knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots  but generally does the job
__label__1 i just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me  i have the bookcd version  i recommend it over just the cd  because it is a better financial deal  and you do not have to read a pdf online or print it out  here are some of the features that i thought were worth noting   the program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections  indicating which sections you have done  you can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on   after doing one will  you can go to the file menu and save for spouse  this creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged  then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes   in the process of answering the questions  the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list  after you mention someone once  the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list  this is handy when doing the healthcare directive  which needs to show contact information  if you have already entered that information when doing the will  it is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document  when working on one family member s document  you can import contacts from another s document   the program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named  the only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together  this is ironic  since the program recommends having only one executor at a time  although i wanted to name my wife  children  and then siblings as alternate executors  i decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate  if all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together  then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor  it would just be more expedient to have one already named   i contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named  the response stated why they chose to omit that option   the editors choose to limit the number of fields for beneficiaries and executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy   and some options  export the document and add the language or return the program   i was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion  i disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy  since they already allow you to list multiple beneficiaries and executors that serve together at the same time   but i liked that i received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what i was talking about  and that they gave an honest  direct answer   at the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print  you can then print it directly to a printer  or export it as plain text or rtf  exporting to rtf is handy if you need to change the document  they advise against changing it  or print it somewhere else  however  the rtf is not identical to printing directly  i noticed two differences     pagination can be different  and as explained by the program  getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons     the footer is always different  the directly printed copy says how many total pages  whereas the rtf one does not  if you cannot print directly to a printer  i recommend printing to a pdf to maintain the pagination and other features  if you do not have a way to create a pdf  get a free pdf writer  search on that term   when you print the document to pdf  print it as prepress so you embed the fonts
__label__1 hollywood make them  then they break them   stars can fall as fast as they rise  sometimes they rise again  and sometimes they disappear  and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in  the big picture   a quirky  cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of  it has a few awkward stretches  but overall it s a darkly witty cult comedy   you re tracking failure all over my carpet     nick chapman  kevin bacon  is the winner at an arty student movie competition  and instantly agents are chasing him all over la in no time  he s the rising young director  with a movie deal at a major movie corporation  but he s also starting to lose sight of his old life  as he tries to become a major success  he changes the style  plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics  turning it into a beach bums  naked ghost movie  he dumps his pretty girlfriend  emily longstreth  for a bimbo actress  teri hatcher   when the studio head gets dropped  nick falls as quickly as he rose  but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance   an arty music video  this time  can he get it right  christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries  tackling everything from smalltown musicals to folk festivals  his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz  but his talents are just as present in a  typical  movie  and guest does a smart  quirky job of it  the lesson  be true to yourself and your art  do nt fall for empty glitz  and do nt let success go to your head if you re lucky enough to get it  the story is a pretty straightforward one   nick gets great success  it goes to his head  he falls  and he rises again a wiser man  and the movie falls into straightforward lines  without many unpredictable plot twists  at first glance  it does nt seem that unusual  what makes it special  well  simply put  guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit  like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick s life  not to mention the glorious dialogue  when speaking of nick s onenonly music video  a studio woman announces   it s the best one yet  and i ve seen  em all   and guest manages to show us agents  artists  students  directors and actors  but never descended to cliches  they re real people  no matter how nasty  and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is  his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet  where he confesses   i wanna be your friend again   and he s backed by good performances by longstreth  michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh   big picture  treads where many movies have gone before  but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video  a mustsee
__label__0 i will start off by saying  i loved my sony cybershot  when the alpha came out i could nt wait to get one  it died after  pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america  amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within  days  i ve spent  hours so far dealing with sony  most people i spoke to or online live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support  computers  video  they also contradicted one another  when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking  pictures they the would only  repair it  not replace it  now i am stuck with a lemon  and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera  i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews  other people have had problems with the camera  i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners  dud cameras were unusual  if you decide to purchase anyway  i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon  but through a real store with a good and fair return policy  that stands behine their products  places like microcenter will exhange  no questions ask  i am kicking myself because amazon was  cheaper then microcenter  penny wise pound foolish  i love amazon  but  i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them  lesson learned on electronics

__label__0 unfortunately  for all the name brand that this book conveys  i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part  there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales  boggles this readers mind  the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session  no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book  and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book  i would be astounded  save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation  by the way  those giving  stars either ca nt read english very well or are shills for mckinsey

__label__0 i feel duped  i bought spy sweeper at the computer store a year ago  it was the  version  at first everything was great  i got my definitions  it found traces  it detected spy cookies  when i ran the definition update  i had no problem with the firewall  every time they said upgrade  i did  then i started getting renew email  i had months to go and they sent me renewal emails sometimes two or three a week and i ignored them  not only because i knew the year was nt up  but i also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information  i emailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them  voicing my concerns  i got ignored  to when i eventually got to speak to someone  they did nt even know what their renewal email looked like  the problems began when i updated the latest version which is the  when i would try to update my definitions i d get a warning that there s was a problem and contact webroot  while it had no problem noting that i had the latest version updates  no settings were changed  not even my firewall which was blamed by them  i think it s them not me since now it s suddenly happening  they refuse to address it  then i checked their site about my subscritpion  i knew i had one because i bought it at the store  my subscription does nt expire until june and if i was invalid i doubt i could upgrade to newer versions  what did their page say  no subscription  when i wrote i never got a straight answer about it  then i was told that the program was corrupted  download a new copy of the latest version from their site  i did  what did i get  boxes that said subscription not activated  they knew i had one and they wo nt change it on their site or give me explanations  after pestering does my latest version now say when i expire  i ve asked why it goes online to scan when it does nt need to and i get ignored  so i decided to call but was nt sure how because i m in a different time zone  it took several days for them to get back to me by email saying that their mountain time is treated like my eastern time to get a hold of someone  the first person i spoke to after four tries at  rings each  was nasty  especially when i told him to slow down because he mumbled  i downloaded what he told me to do  he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about itthe second person sounded like he d smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after  rings  he did nt know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying i had no subscription when the program in it s latest version finally admitted i m current after pestering  they do nt give you straight email answers  they do nt answer their phones hoping that after the th ring you ll give up  it wo nt scan everything even when no other programs are running  in the new version it found a spy cookie  it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as  always remove  never did that with the previous versions  i do nt like a company who answers questions selectively  i do nt like a company who makes you wait  rings  i do nt like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions  webroot s spy sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works  and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status
__label__1 this product does make the appetite disappear   however it made me very irritable while i took it  i took it for four days so i did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked  the pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation  everyone is affected differently when taking things so i would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away
__label__1 the optical x zoom on the canon a is is already better than cameras in it s range  ie non slr   however  the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size  the tele converter lens really does make a difference  firstly  if there are any negatives  they are very minor  the lens and adapter are black  would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera  erm  that s it  the main quality of canon is the lens  which they always do well  the clarity of this lens is very good  with very little fuzziness at the edge  it also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected  the electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment  the tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want

__label__1 this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall  release postponed due to     it s plot included terrorists that sell a bomb   i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to  get shorty  rather than as a plot driven movie  i tell you though  this film is simply funny  just like an old marx brothers film  the plot is there only to set in motion the quickwitted dialogue and interaction between the characters  i have enjoyed both of dave barry s humor novels  this and  tricky business    they made me laugh out loud as did this movie  i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly  for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in  get shorty and even  snatch   he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks  literally  on his trip to do a quick sniper job  tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you ll ever see  there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh  no matter how many times you have seen it  check this one out
__label__1 malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail  i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs  matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books  he almost makes the process seem easy  and maybe it is  if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant  however  much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a  plateaued  or  downward spiraling  church that has been around for  years  the principles are easy and make sense if you have  support of the congregation  that s pretty hard to do in most of the churches i ve been in that need strategic planning the most  that s no fault of malphurs  the book itself is a great book
__label__1 jon brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music  hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie  if you liked this movie  by all means  buy the soundtrack  you will not be dissapointed  eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie  it makes me feel  just  good  also  be sure to pick up his solo record  meaningless  if you liked the movie  buy this cd  you wont regret it

__label__1 herb alpert has done what few artists can do  he s taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original  i love the original  whipped cream   but this cd is a masterstroke  combining alpert s traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing  but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end  unlike some of the purists  i loved this cd and you will too
__label__0 the author had a great idea  but he cherrypicked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense  for example  superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww two jewish guys  right at the end of ww  write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b  c it s destroyed  etc  etc i m not critiscizing this book b  c it has a religious message  i m critiscizing it b  c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement  otherwise  i disagree with anybody that says it is  just a comic   superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america

__label__1 release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own  it will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see  i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have  you also get to find out who dirty is or whatever  pete says things about him in a couple of places  online  and all i could think is  who is that   so thats also very exciting  i would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this  remember  its the stuff deemed  unfit  for  my heart with always be the bside to my tongue
__label__1 upgraded from an old norelco to this and just love it  shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip  the only con i see is the  hour charge time  which has been the norm for norelcos in this class for a long time  if you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price  this is a great choice
__label__0 i really did nt enjoy the movie  but i had to finish it  the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the socalled fundamentalist that i know  but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying  this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity  though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name  it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him  when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god  she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision  christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word  no one actually reads a bible in the movie  consequently  most made many lifedamaging decisions  i hated the  reality  of the movie  but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him  i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is
__label__1 used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton  mi  in the up  and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections  lost signal a few times   this works best when you have two people  driver and navigator  as looking over at a laptop while driving is nt a good thing  would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would nt expect it
__label__0 this joe damato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze  bordering on pornography  the plot  or lack thereof  is typical  woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption  to make the film last  minutes  joe damato fills the story with lesbianism  vile tortures  naked women in rat infested sewers  and plenty of gratuitous sex  i gave this movie  star because there is no option for a  star rating  even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore
__label__1 i am totally satisfied with product features  for me still it s better than any available product from other company in this segment  i ranked this product  because it manual dial malfunction very often  if i select album mode it still thinks to be in snapshot mode and viceversa  it s out of guarantee and i ll hv to live with it  anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like w or something like that
__label__1 most of the world still runs on pcs and as a mac owner  and lover   it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting  i m a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio  tv  video games and so on  as a freelancer  i need something to keep track of my business banking  credit cards  expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively  just like my mac  i used myob a mac accounting program but found it to be tricky and did nt end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that i expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours  it could be that i did nt understand the program well enough  but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help  so no thanks myob  in fact  i put off doing most of my  accounting until january  because i dreaded trying to figure out myob again  then i broke down and bought quickbooks for mac  it did everything i needed it to a year s worth of accounting in a weekend and i never even cracked the manual  it allowed me to save the year as a pc file to hand to my accountant on a cd  a few days later he handed me back a cd with a mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent  i ca nt speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because i never got that deep into the program  but for my needs it s right on the money
__label__1 i use and like most all of the olay lines of products  this one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well  i ca nt wait for the one that has a  hint of tan  in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market  i heard about it  but apparently it is not out as of yet
__label__1 i love this film  beautifully simple and human  the characters are real  flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them  just like your own family  i ve rented at least fifteen times  and i never get bored of it  it s great any time of year  but fantastic for the holidays
__label__1 this is the best and easiest to use back brush  i have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just did nt do it but with this brush no more missed spots  just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time  never felt so clean
__label__1 yep  it extends the eyepiece out a little bit  which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display  but it also distorts the view in an annoying way  i use mine on occasion  but not all the time
__label__1 i heard this music on the excellent p b s documentary   quot  liberty  the american revolutionquot  and i knew i had to have it  it is the finest music i have heard  capturing the heart and soul of the american revolution  the documentary  quot  libertyquot  was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving  so too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment  i love it  i could hardly wait to get it in the mail  it framed the documentary  which i also bought  like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting  superlatives fail me  this music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the american revolution and then by listening to it apart  this is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard  it reminds me of the genius of aaron copland who wrote the applachian spring and rodeo suites

__label__0 after three weeks the batteries fails  i buy a knew one in walmart  and less expensive
__label__0 when the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit  the power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge  you cannot replace the regargable battery yourself  sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one  as for the shave  not bad  but not exceptional either  the cutters a very tiny  not built to last  and are not durable  all rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used  this shaver may last you a few months  a year   to  years will be a stretch  i also have a braun and a norelco  the norelco is years old and running fine  the braun is  years  both have original cutters and foil  i heavy duty clean them in  alchohol about once a year  and brush out debris about once every  uses  these units dont have batteries and this is why i purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available  the remington shaver really needs to have it s cutter blades cleaned  brushed off or washed  after every use  what a pain   i find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver  than one that will last
__label__1 torzók    abandoned   is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by árpád sopsits that takes us back to hungary of  when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone  especially children  the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring  it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended  but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure  áron  tamás mészáros  is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce  the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father  sándor gáspár  beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters  áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive  he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother s blindness by his friend atilla  szabolcs csizmadia  and the two bond emotionally and physically  in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya  krisztina somogyi  but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff  there is one  teacher  in the orphanage school  nyitrai  lászló gálffi  who has been reduced to his position as an  imprisoned one  by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy  nyitrai offers áron solace and introduces his  fellow traveler  to the glory of the stars  giving áron a map of the heavens that áron cherishes  his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prisonlike orphanage  he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai  in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government  hangs himself  this horrid incident drives áron to organize an escape from the orphanage  an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which áron feels responsible  and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger  the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by péter szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period  the musical score by péter fejcsik  tamás görgényi  ferenc toma  and balázs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen  making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings  in all  this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking  acted with depth in every role  and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books  highly recommended  grady harp  march

__label__0 i liked this when it first came out b  c i was  i was a rebel  wanted to be part of something different  this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while  favorite song is mongoloidtotally strange but rocking song   uncontrollable urge  rocks  in a weird way  and come back johnny is almost a conventional song  satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song  the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss  multi media  making money kind of thing  i saw them live  they were horrible  during their hey day  the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream  devo is still as odd of a group as ever  mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work  rugrats  and you can hear the devo in all of his work  anybody that gives this novelty group  stars is cheapening what true excellent music is  devo came out as a goof  not as serious musicians  they got big in the  s b  c they were part of the new wave and kids  like me  were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own
__label__0 i hate it when rock stars form those gd awful  supergroups   ca nt people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more  there s no such thing as a good supergroup  the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to uck  when damn yankees released their  debut  every song on it was so incredibly generic  there was no hope for this band  the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together  they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs  it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their  supergroup  scam  the big  booming  arena rock choruses just ring hollow  i guess they re trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks  but to me  it just sounds like a lot of filler  supergroups will always suck  because they diliberately try to sound bad  thats right people  supergroup members know that since they re already popular  the album they re putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller    why bother trying to come up with good songs  we re already popular  so people will buy it no matter how bad it is  lets just put out filler   supergroups are a total farce  its just easy money for the people involved  and nothing more  if you buy any album by any supergroup  than you my friend  are a sucker  if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best  just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album  and avoid anything by damn yankees  or any other supergroup
__label__0 st elmo s fire  is one of those movies that could have been better  should have been better and yet  it just wasnt  it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the s  the socalled brat pack  well  everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall  who were spared this misstep   maybe this was supposed to be  the breakfast club   after college   but while  the breakfast club  had characters  even stereotypical characters  that you could relate to  there is absolutely no one  with the exception of emilio estevez  character  that you care enough about to relate to in this film  the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois  but georgetown  where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college  uhhuh  yeah  right  judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage   problem is  nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy  in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that  andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy  or maybe it s just the pearls   emilio estevez is a future attorney  working as a waiter  server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell  mare winningham is a dowdy  trustfund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity  working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her  she instead fantasizes about rob lowe  who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band  who has dropped out of school  married a white trashy looking groupie  had a child with her and has now separated from her  and taking up with other groupies  demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking  has a serious coke problem  stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol  sounds promising  huh  well  in what is an early portend of the  melrose place  to come  sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is  dumps his ass  immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy  who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job  estevez  after screwing up a lucrative housesitting job by hosting a party there  travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her  he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed  he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home  lowe  in between fauxplaying his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere  takes winningham s virginity and heads back to his estranged missus  moore  after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother  has all her furnishings repossessed  loses her job and freaks out  not exactly  the breakfast club   the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves  with the exception of estevez  character  they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped  their every action  every line of dialogue seems like just that   they seem very one dimensional  their socalled angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that  winningham s character could have been salvagable  except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy  knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was  and yet  she still gave her virginity to him  maybe if winningham was nt so bright  or she was a college freshman  it would be understandable  but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent  lowe really had little to do with his role  maybe if he had played the role nelson had   as the roving lothario  with sheedy waiting at home  it might have gone over better  with his toopretty looks  it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him  nelson just does nt seem comfortable and does nt pull it off  but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player  moore basically plays herself  an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems  mirroring her character   but was later rehired  while the title song later become a minor hit   st elmo s fire  itself missed the mark

__label__0 this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet  so i bought this specifically for that use  i used the triangular pumice attachment onlyi was under the impression that the attachment would rotate  but in general it s just a vibrating   levels  machine with attachments that you move around your body manually  the vibrations were nt intense enough to make any difference  the actual machine has no function  the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok  but can easily be used without this machine
__label__0 i purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products  my last internet security product was pccillin  i did nt renew because of the low ratings for    what i found was that an huge load was put on my processor  and system memory apparently because i use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam  i never had problems like this before  and after some research on the za support site  i found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking  vsmonexe seems to be the culprit  and is the main component of the zone alarm product  everything seems fine  as long as i do nt try to use video over the internet  including im webcams   i would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase
__label__0 i am from australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to amazon  is a complete season of baywatch really baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly  the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing  i do nt think so  not only have the distributors done fans no favours but amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast  on the amazon website as part of advertising for season  they have incorrectly labeled it  if you go by the cast that amazon have put on  you would think that it was the real original season   when we know it is not  the release in the uk  which is out now and the upcoming release in australia on march th is the real deal  season  is the real season  and all subsequent seasons are correct  there are no episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact  might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal  aaro
__label__0 although i am definitely on the  sonicare  bandwagon in so far as this product s ability to clean my teeth it does a great job this model brush is made quite poorly  the battery compartment  the e uses  aa  batteries  on mine  regardless of it having an oring on the door  seems to be continually wet inside  with the negative    terminal on one of the aacells rusting after only two weeks use  philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution  also  there are many small crevices in  around the nameplate on the side  and a large gap under the nut for the brushhead that accumulates  gook  on a daily basis  philips advises that this is probably  mold  and the brush should be  disassembled and airdried  after every use  it takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth  again  while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time  and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at e  and up   there is no reason why the e should nt be made as well as the better units  or hold up to water  daily use as well as some of the  crest electrics we commonly see
__label__1 the first epilator that i used was the epilady with coils that came out in the s  i did not use this for long  a tool of complete torture  i finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from  veet  which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that i was completely hooked on using an epilator  goodbye razors and wax  i figured that if a single roller did a good job that the conair which had two rollers would do even better  the conair does a good job and i m keeping it as my spare  but the epilator from veet actually does a better job  i no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and i even do my bikini area and underarms  i love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing  once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over  update  i ve had more time to use the conair epilator and now i ve actually been using it more than my  veet   just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it  as a matter of fact i am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends
__label__0 i ordered this and  while i m a fan of other therabeads products  i found this poorly designed  unless you have a very thick neck  the velcro straps are worse than useless  they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover  the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck   and then it did nt cover the neck well
__label__0 colorado s san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa  so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd  i decided to rent it on netflix  it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish  and the kids  while cute  outsmart all the stupid adults  the first  minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango  including the steam train  that s why i purchased a used copy  but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore  intended for young and undemanding children  do nt bother unless you love durango as much as i do

__label__0 i recently read robert monroe s first book   journeys out of body  and found it to be a disappointment  it was just weird  as i noted in my review of that book  i had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound  for which he is allegedly noted  as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read  i thought i d give it a try  the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his  research  and i thought that  perhaps  this book might actually have some real substance  that belief  however  quickly disappeared  by the time i had reached the halfway point in the book  nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish  how does total garbage like this manage to get printed   there are those that claim that monroe was a highly leftbrained individual who delved into the realm of the creative rightbrain  if this book is any indication  one ca nt help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere  there is nothing logical or  for that matter  even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book  it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner  instead  he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own  personal  dream experiences  these wander so aimlessly  from paragraph to paragraph  that one ca nt help but wonder what real point  if any  he was trying to make  the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work  i was actually quite interested in the topic  having now been subjected to two of his useless books  i m amazed that they re still in print  this is pseudoscience at its absolute worst

__label__0 hypocrisy alert  hypocrisy alert  i just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start  not more than twentyfour hours ago i wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film  i argued that fans should nt viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all  in other words  we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies  now that i have gotten that out of the way  i shall proceed to trash  adam  evil   i did nt set out to heap scorn on this film when i popped it in the dvd player a few weeks ago  although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and i felt my heart sinking  in fact  nothing screams  straight to video  more loudly than a film entitled  adam  evil   well  perhaps something like  adam  the bollweevil   or even  adam  evil knievel  might rank as likelier candidates  but you get the idea   adam  evil  does not inspire confidence that i m about to watch a slasher film on par with carpenter s  halloween   right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichéd slasher film hell  the movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks  there is seth  kevin robson   the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition  then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette yvonne  erica cerra   next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film  the ever important  loud guy  matt  brody harms   along for the ride are evelyn  barbara kottmeier   adam himself  sean arnfinson   adam s girlfriend yvette  lynsey brothers   and a few other kids  i am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the eve connotation in the three girls  names  and that seth is also a name pulled straight out of the old testament  where matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the new testament  something tells me the matthew responsible for the gospel did nt go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as  matt   call it a gut feeling  anyway  these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip  drinking  and romping around in the water  sounds familiar  does nt it  see those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision  they re called red flags  things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals  with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff  are nt interested in helping out  too  a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest  if you think we ll see him again before the credits roll  that s one bet i wo nt take  i should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group  adam and his friend matt did something quite idiotic a few years before namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there that continues to haunt them to this day  too  one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with  both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful  i laugh defiantly at such nonsense  i wo nt spoil the ending for you  but i will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the  twist  ending  for a slasher film   adam  evil  is downright puritanical with the red stuff  i felt like a bizarro clara peller hollering   where s the gore   every time a killing went down  seth  for example  perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless  off camera fashion  a couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond  again a rather bloodless affair  the presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things a promise unfulfilled  unfortunately   adam  evil  is one of the tamest slashers i have ever seen  what did they do  turn the script over to the hayes commission before shooting scenes  note to aspiring filmmakers  if you re going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release  go over the top with the sauce  at least then you ve got a shot at making a cult classic  and another thing  make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film  sure  you ll have to shell out a few more bucks  but it s worth it  remember  unless i m laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted  so bad it s good  label  ham handed performances can only hurt you  surprisingly  the dvd comes with a commentary track  not that you ll want to listen to it  but there it is  we also get a few trailers for three other schlock films   contagion    hallow s end   and  asylum days   forget about picking up a copy of  adam  evil   it s not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf  there are plenty

__label__0 i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject  there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title  i read this book because it was the subject of an online book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group
__label__0 i had jvc product and some of my friends too  these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem  even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly  price may be less buy its not worth for long run  i feel sony and canon are better than jvc  even hitachi is good
__label__1 this music is undefinable ultimately  oh yes  one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive  one can say many things about it  for me  this  along with  up the downstairs  are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day  i ve become a collector of pt s stuff and like most of it very much indeed  check out some of the side projects of the members in the band like blackfield and noman  they are worth good listenings too  but  you know  this would nt be a bad album to start your pt experience with  no  not at all
__label__1 this one came out in   its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass  one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track  so it forces you to listen to this long  winding  sludgefest in its entirety  as most melvins fans know  this  along with houdini  was the pinacle of their musical career  after this  they made some great albums and some good ones  but never better than their selftitled album  previously titled  lysol   but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit   it would be ultracool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe reissue treatment  it definitely deserves it
__label__1 dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today  threading the thin line between commercial and underground  and finding his niche somewhere in between  as unkle says  the middle ground between light and shadow  dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth  i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release  and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing  which is by far dj shadow s best album  and one of the best albums ever made  by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create minimovies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value  and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music  i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is  a work of art  and a continual growing of shadow s talents  had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i m sure i would have garnered it with a  star review  but that is simply not the case here  while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album  josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album  and given us an album that i m sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time  best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home  possibly with a little mary in tow  if you know what i mean   the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows  and the beats are flawless  especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis  see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels  and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve  radiohead for example has a way of doing this  and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead  they both fuse these elements into their music  and achieve monumental status in my opinion  the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation  and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package  if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works  endtroducing  preemptive strike  the private press  and in tune and on time  which is a live set recorded in support of this album  unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hiphop  rock and techno  with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys  thom yorke from radiohead  and others from throughout the music industry  if you ve never heard of dj shadow before  then i must say that you are missing out  if you are at all interested in underground music  do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow s albums or collaborations  i guarantee you will extremely impressed  as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time  peace out
__label__0 whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least  or  fingers  robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs  that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey  or peter lang  is puzzling to say the least  but  credit where credit s due  it s not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant

__label__1 it is light  has x magnification  and easy to use  this little tool is great for any golfer  you must know the yardage before you can select the correct club  how far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick  next  you just then need to pull the club that will get you there  fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag  these new laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models  love it

__label__0 i got hooked on tiesto about  years ago  heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album  neverhteless  it was nt but it was still tiesto though right  wellthe hits on this cd are about  years old  the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about  times from other various artists  stick with  tiestonyana   times better
__label__0 i m not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the season    box sets  which is how you re better off seeing them  at least they re in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes   instead i will be focusing on the bonus features  not the violent femmes music video  because that too can be found on the season  box set  but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features  i love the interviews and the  in studio  voice recording reenactments  but i hate how every piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame  you can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen  and even then it is nt clear as there s a bubble  shine  over it  i d love for paramount  nick to include all of the original  nonbubblefied footage on the season  box set  even though most of the episodes are for seasons  and
__label__0 we just bought this camera to replace our minidv jvcdvl that was bought in  in short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is very grainy and dark  i applied the workaround listed above  but found that i had to set the frame rate to    in order to ge the brightness that i needed which caused a very jittery image  the quality of this camera is something that i would expect for   needless to say i am returning this camera today

__label__1 an exofficer in the argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered  i ca nt write  quot  highly recommendedquot  about this book  because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event  just read it  you may not be able to sleep for few nights  but you ll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes  supported by the united states only because they were  quot  anticommunistquot
__label__0 while well produced  i was disappointed in the album  mostly because the majority of the tracks were rerecordings  frankie laine still sounds great  but it just was nt the same  i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album  but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly  and in a couple of cases very   different in tempo and vocal inflection  it s definitely not the album i ve loved for over  years  high noon in particular is quite different  much slower  with vocal emphasis changed  i ll probably listen to the cd from time to time  but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp
__label__1 this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown s career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection  cynthia rose s  living in america  the soul saga of james brown   geoff brown s biography  james brown   and ofcourse  the brown  tucker  the godfather of soul  james brown   all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician s mind but this one has a stronger narrative  a bit less guarded  his late  s fall is described in a more contrite way  for example  his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue  but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men  then immediately moves on to the next thought  even by  standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality  obviously directed at the female fans  ever recorded  similarly  his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap  hiphop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit selfrighteous  there is alot of  adult  content in his catalogue which ca nt be explained away as  art   however  fans can trace his development into more  cerebral  music  with more and more sensitive ballads and sociallyconscious tunes being produced from the late  s on  i was happy to read his description of little richard s assistance in his early career  but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver  i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor  the influence is quite obvious and not just on  chonnie on chon   another depressing ommission is with marva whitney  his popular lead female vocalist from c   to   a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup  despite the above concerns  with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer  ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world  just listen to  do nt be a drop out    i do nt want nobody to give me nothing    the man in the glass    i m not demanding    it s christmas time   and  peace in the world
__label__1 love this movie  ca nt decide which version i like better  this one or the one with grace kelly and bing crosby  both are great
__label__1 this item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it  thanks
__label__0 great product for what it does  however  my experience with quicken products such as will maker is that there are no updates  you ll have to buy the next year s version to stay up to date for changes in your state  at the end of   the software is obsolete
__label__1 love this digital camera compared to our previous ones  we re mostly a pointandclick family  and this is an easytouse camera that does a good pointandclick and gives an opportunity to do more if you should so choose some day
__label__1 i first used this product when i got a straight razor shave in a men s salon awhile back  it really made for a smooth shave  which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave  by the way  i do nt recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as i foolishly did  your face will be very sore  it took me  years before i got another straight razor shave  and i hated it as much as the first time  i ll never get another  however  this oil product made the shave tolerable  and it makes daily shaving fantastic  this combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave  it s amazing how soft your skin feels afterward  buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave  and you wo nt be disappointed
__label__1 i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
__label__0 im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly  his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with icet  mcginly s films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world  he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast  which included hacks like paul rudd  was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and icet who have graced some of his previous work  please sean  stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff  leave that to idiots like capra  wenders  scorcese etc they are not in your league
__label__1 this was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable  they sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly
__label__0 this stuff smells bad  like a mix of medicine and pesticide  had to throw it out
__label__1 it takes some getting used to  but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave  i got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks  but i think i was pressing too hard like i had to with my old razor  just a light touch gives a close shave  the attachable sideburn trimmer does nt do a very good job in my opinion  but i kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose  the gel packs go pretty quickly  but maybe i m using too much  i m still trying to get the hang of it  it s a different experience than your basic razor
__label__1 i love this cd  everything they sing about is so true to life  it s a great arrangement of songs
__label__0 this book was a huge disappointment  not only was nt it funny to me  it has absolutely nothing funny for kids  too bad its not worth the return shipping charges  i threw it out
__label__1 i have looked everywhere for this charger  everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work  it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera  it s just the right size and plugs right into the wall  the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carryon bag  thanks so much for having this item available
__label__0 in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them  i wish i had known this before  now i have to waste about  in shipping to return it  do not buy for body fat measurement
__label__0 this book is a place to start at best  the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices  this book calls for dried spices at times  the dishes do nt produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family  the book is not a total loss  however  the spinach pies are acceptable  there are many other books out there that i would recommend first
__label__0 i enjoyed the first saw and kinda like the second but this has got to stop no more of the cruel heartless first it was people who did nt appreciate life now it any old hasbeen or no name d talented actor i am willing to watch another saw movie only if paris hilton  nicole richie and lindsay lohan are attach large boulder and drop in some in super deep quick sand
__label__0 ok  at long last public enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of subpar average  noninnovative  nonavent guard  dj s mix there stuff up  even dj spookie s mix was not that grand  everything sounds like beats that i discovered in the early s  on the other hand  this album is only a couple bucks used  so i would highly highly highly suggest buying it if only for  boom which is perhaps one of the best pe tracks ever to come out  not only are the beats right on  but the lyrics are some of the hardest i ve heard yet  and for the note  my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound  infact i love the new pe  whirl odor  even though it has club friendly sounds  mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats  they are very multilayered  and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder  and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world  lyness
__label__0 now  if we re being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts  but maybe just because people are lowering their standards  besides  the fact that i dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges  this cd is no  dangerously in love   where beyonce s sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album  cole s raspy voice and sometimey pitch concern me  aside from the obvious car banger  i just want it to be over  and the wildly popular  love   which cole butchers when singing live by the way   nothing here surprises me  like i said  you can call me a hater  but with women like beyonce and fantasia around cole s fire will probably be put out soon
__label__1 i m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard  i ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated  so i have to carefully prep for shaving  after years of trial and error  i ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system  cetaphil skin cleanser for a base  then kiss my face moisture shave as a supplement  for postshave comfort and to prevent breakouts  i use a product like cleanclear dualaction oilfree moisturizing lotion  however  the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver  with the gillette fusion power  i ve finally found the right one  i ve used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first gulf war  i was in the marines at the time   they ve gotten the job done  but a blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type  it does nt take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck  especially since i take forever to change blades  i dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots  not to mention getting blood stains on my collar   electric shavers do nt work for me either  too hard on my skin  and i d have a fiveoclock shadow around pm  so  when i saw gillette touting their new blade system  i gave it a shot  i was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers  but the fusion power is the happy exception  at first i struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end  but once i mastered that maneuver and got the battery in  i was set  it takes one aaabattery that seems to last a decent interval  the lowbattery indicator is a nice touch   and even if the fusion power runs out of juice  you can still shave with it  the shaver glides over my face  and the vibration feels good  kind of like a pickmeup in the morning  the five blades really nail my beard  and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cutfree  i also like the oneblade trimmer on top  very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils  my only issue is the expense of the blades  but i can make them last a lot longer than the old blade razors while still getting a great shave  and most importantly  i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore  if i do  it s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else   ultimately  the result is worth the higher price  the gillette fusion power is the best shaver i ve ever tried  highly recommended
__label__1 it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film  had he lived  the crow sequels would have been much better  the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace  it set the standard for the dark cinema of the s
__label__0 i purchased partition magic  based on my previous experience with symantec virus protection and firewall products  i am sorry that i did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by symantec for other products that i have purchased from them  all i wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my c  drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive  i was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with symantec technical support  i was only able to speak to technical support staff in india who finally told me that they could not solve my problem  but that i would be called back by a senior engineer  it never happened despite repeated promises  i finally gave up and returned the product to symantec for a refund
__label__1 the fisheye lens is a lot of fun  and i enjoy using mine  however  i find that the practicality of the lens is minimal  i do nt usually want my  serious  photographs to have fisheye distortion  i do nt tend to like the x crop on canon s lowerend digital slr cameras  but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit  it s reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wideangle lens  since most of the distortion is removed by the x crop  you can still get distortion  but it s a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a x camera than a fullframe camera  either way  lots of fun  buy one for the enjoyment  or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it  but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these
__label__1 well  the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great compared to other battery operated shavers i agree  my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each  google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries  some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys
__label__1 this camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera  i too was disappointed after converting the raw files with c pro and acr  was it possible that my drebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like swartzenegger s arm  even with l glass the results were dissapointing  the problem is not with the camera but with the workflow  after using it for  months i am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results i am looking for  i had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves  once i got over the fact that i would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before i was content and have never touched the drebel ever since  ps beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any l zoom lens  buy the hand strap or a better neck strap  some photo samples can be found here  http    wwwtrekearthcom  members  nbournas  photos
__label__0 i wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that adobe audition  will not install on a windows  pro or server operating system  almost every reference i have seen regarding os requirements say windows but not specifically windows xp  the only exceptions have been on the audition box itself and this amazon listing  go amazon   so if you are a windows  user understand that you will need xp for this product  if you can find a copy of audition  you re good to go  i would say more about the product if i could actually get it installed but with the  pcs i use not a one has xp so i have a  book end until i can upgrade  if you can call it that  to xp
__label__0 i purchased this album because i am a fan of the last poets  upon listening to the samples provided by amazoncom  i thought i was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the last poets  some great politically charged poetry  perhaps accompanied by some funky beats  however  when i listened to the whole cd  i was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like  get out of the ghetto blues   if more of the tracks had the sound of the title track  this would be a fivestar album  in my opinion  true  scottheron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album  but not in the form i had hoped for  i would take the last poets  album  this is madness  over this particular scottheron album
__label__1 i really liked this movie  i thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it  it was well told and the characters were well developed  the special effects were great too   i am not one for comic book heros  but this one confinced me otherwise  i recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character
__label__0 i did nt watch millenium when it was on ten years ago  so i thought i d give it a try on dvd  as i m a big xfiles fan  i watched two shows   the beginning and the end  and  the dogs   they were ridiculous and boring  i m done with millenium
__label__1 i love  fool for the city  i have also always loved savoy brown  looking in  and did nt know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat  if you are a foghat fan you should check out  looking in  by savoy brown  if you ve heard other stuff by savoy brown and did nt like it  do nt be discouraged because  looking in   and only  looking in   is essentially foghat  there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best
__label__1 as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid  too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid  i need not have worried  tim obrien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i ve followed for some time  not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks  mostly songs  are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions  there are superb performances all round  vocally from obrien with guests paul brady  maura oconnell  kathhy mattea  del mccoury etc and musicians altan  frankie gavin  jerry douglas  earl scruggs  seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh  acoustic and vital  requiring no production gimmicks or effects  standout songs for me personally are  quot  mountaineer is always freequot    quot  lost little childrenquot    quot  wanderingquot  and  quot  john rileyquot  although there is not a weak track on the cd  it is obvious that for tim obrien this has been a labour of love  if you like acoustic music  from any tradition  either side of the atlantic  you ll love it  several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant
__label__1 this is a great show and very entertaining  the story is nt the greek classic  but it s a fine riff on it  the songs are good  and they grow on you as you watch  i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character  it s just a cartoon  for pete s sake  like some other reviewers  i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing  go the distance  over the end credits  but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version   no importa la distancia   sung by ricky martin  and it is killer  this one is well worth the money
__label__0 mr dennett s book demonstrates the ignorance  irrationality  and dishonesty of humanists  discussing the meaning of word materialsim  professor dennett says   in its scientific or philosophical sense  it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial like a cartesian soul  or  ectoplasm   or god  the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic  which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance  matter and whatever minds are supposedly made of    p    philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics  a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence  the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism  it is naturalism  materialism is the view that all that exists is matter  materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena   in a quote below  you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in   it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist  but he is certainly a naturalist  concerning the proof of god s existence  he trots out david hume s  who made god   which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality  i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof  let s look at two quotes  the first is at the end of the chapter  belief in belief  and the other at the beginning of the chapter  morality and religion    that is  is nt it true that  whether or not god exists  religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy  in the rule of law  in free will  the very widespread  but far from universal  opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning    p     without the divine carrot and stick  goes this reasoning  people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires  beak their promises  cheat on their spouses  neglect their duties  and so on  there are two wellknown problems with this reasoning     it does nt seem to be true  which is good news  since    is is such a demeaning view of human nature    p    in the first chapter  he mentions  bulwark of morality  and  meaning   but in the second chapter  he leaves out  meaning   if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven  what is our purpose is life  whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief  mr dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians  there are worse things than divorcing your spouse  disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said  mr dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life  the only miracle mentioned in mr dennett s book is the shroud of turin  which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man  since no one claims to know how the image got there  it can be called a miracle  however  mr dennett does not tell us anything about it  the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet
__label__0 i started reading this book hoping for the best  in turn  i found that my hopes were nt fulfilled  the beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more  after the tone changed  the book became bitter and boring  the characters lost their flare  and the whole book lost personality  the book became dull and lost appeal to me  the book s writing style  in the beginning  was original and fun  following the death of little red the book slowly fell apart  leaving me tempted to stop reading the book  if someone asked me to recommend a good book  this would not be the one

__label__1 this is one of the best  if not the best  pure screwball comedies of the s  next to the original thin man movie  libeled lady is my favorite powell  loy effort  this time  the magic chemistry of that oftpaired duo is enhanced by the box officedrawing talents of fellow megastars spencer tracy and jean harlow  the first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four topdrawer actors merrily  confidently stride arminarm toward the camera  the plot is convoluted  the star has erroneously printed a story about heiress connie allenbury  myrna loy   portraying her as a marriage wrecker  connie immediately files a  million dollar libel suit  star newspaper editor warren haggerty  spencer tracy  counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman bill chandler  william powell  to romance connie and place her in a compromising position  thus negating the lawsuit  haggerty convinces his harried  longsuffering fiancee gladys benton  jean harlow  to instead marry the bachelor chandler as part of the scheme  things get really tricky when gladys falls for chandler and chandler falls for connie  who eventually falls for chandler  and haggerty  he pretty much spends the movie just seething  yet everything ends fairly well  even if there s still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom  libeled lady boasts mixups and complications galore and couples matching  crossmatching and mismatching  sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy  delicious acting is laid in by four stars who  throughout their film careers  never ever lost their prime  powell proves again his mastery of the confused doubletake and  along with the wry  understated myrna loy  dominates the refined repartees  and representing the more lowbrow couple  tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and harlow the affronted looks  walter connolly as connie s anglingloving father is simply wonderful  the intricate storyline is easy to follow  thanks to the clear helmsmanship of jack conway  with this cinematic venture  hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars  i think it s brilliant stuff
__label__1 this case is vital to protect the lightweight s which could be easily damaged from a drop  the case does not detract from the convenience of the s  it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily
__label__0 after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out  i was extremely disappointed  the movie very well could be alright on its own merits  but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful
__label__0 title says it all  it simply does not work  yes it turns and trims a hair here and there  but i would not purchase this again  i am happy with my other wahl product
__label__0 i do nt have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose  i do nt see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all  as i said i do nt have a huge melon like mike myers s brother in  so i married an axe murderer   the idea  concept is great buti ll probably return them  unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them  people with really big heads  caveat emptor
__label__0 i was very happy with my quickbooks basics  but for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the basics version  so i was forced to upgrade to pro  it is much slower than basics  it s more complicated to backup  it asks so many questions   also it takes longer to print a simple check  again too many clicks before it prints
__label__0 i thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself  however  the truth is you need money to invest in real estate  so  there s really no way around it  which made her book redundant  she just gave examples of  people with  different investment strategies  in the end  the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth  i really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties
__label__0 this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets  quite small for the price  just paying for the name on the bag
__label__1 in generalthis program worked very well  i ve had a hard time putting my new dual core pentium d computer in the raid  configuration  so i bought this instead  the clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the raid  configuration  but i was a bit confused about how to use the  incremental backup  function  the initial backup went well  but when i went back for incremental backup additions  it would tell me it was  impossible  so i just clone the c drive every few weeks now  i have two seagate  gb sata hard drives  and it s great to know that i have an exact copy of the c drive if i fry it  i live in ethiopia  so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous  i ve already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities  i d buy this product again  and it s comforting to know that it s on my system and that i can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when i need to
__label__1 to my knowlege  there simply is nt a better equipped camera for the professional investigator  it s irsensitive mode  nightshot  is in bw  rather than cheeseygreen   far superior qualitywise to anything sony s got  and it s the only ccd that i know of with a lowlight mode  the image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade  time  date stamps can be  burned in  so they xfer via firewire  again  the only camera i m aware of with this feature  the audio can be turned off which we know is a must  and best yet  you can disable the sleepmode so it wo nt turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on  it s built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand  but it s still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame  finally  it s totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing  the only downside so far as i can tell is it s size  it s a big camera compared to the handicams i ve had  and would nt be well suited for closeproximity work  however  the black casing dos nt print  siloutte terribly  and the x optical lets you set back quite a bit  highly recommended
__label__1 i am not sure about my baby  but i love this cd  actually baby loves it too but probably not to that great extent
__label__1 this blood pressure monitor is everything i was looking for and the price was certainly right  thank you  it works perfectly
__label__0 i bought  and  units  they are not working in my small condo  i cannot find the place to see how they finally work
__label__0 i have an olympus fe  camera and the battery did not fit  my niece has an olympus fe  camera and the battery did not fit in hers either  the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck
__label__0 the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz  and by extension the fz which has an identical body   i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out  if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca nt fit in the bag at all  there s also no padding to speak of with this case  by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure  padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again  targus makes decent laptop cases  but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently  apparently it does fit some cameras  just not the panasonic fzs  considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
__label__0 i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring  it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters  he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for  the swede   without letting us know who the swede really is  roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration  it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book  i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times
__label__1 i have had  other sonicare toothbrushes and love them  i shopped around and due to amazon s fabulous return policy and excellent customer servicethere was no question where i would purchase  their price was very competitive and their excellent customer service made it easy to feel good about buying here
__label__0 i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films  to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection  i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film  but i was very disappointed to say the least  the movie takes place in the early eighties  when gangs dressed in leather with chains  carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally  this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in  if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed
__label__0 beautiful voice  but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd  i was offended just reading every name on this cdit is really a shame  what pretty  vulgar  voice  if this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears  you should be ashamed of yourself as an artist  as you have such power  but it is spent on prepetuating hate  nina simone was a angry artist also  but not once did she offend me  caucasian male  with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america  the first song i ever heard of hers  mississippi goddam  made me cry  so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice  there will always be a  racist america  because people are selfish  but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist  i liked the cd until i heard the lyrics  one less sale adds up after awhile
__label__1 this is a wonderful effort by the del castillo brothers and their band  mark and rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that i have ever heard  i hate that anyone would compare them to the gypsy kings or strunz and farrah  because i believe they  del castillo  are far superior  even though i am a huge fan of santana  i think brothers of the castle and vida are more entertaining and satisfying than santana s last cd  if you are a fan of this genre  you should possess both del castillo cds brothers of the castle and vida  their live show is among the best that i have ever seen
__label__0 i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie  the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face  one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel  it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves  the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction  apparently oprah s as well
__label__0 these are the bulkiest  leakiest diapers i ve ever used  even though they do nt have bleach  there is still tons of pesticide used in cotton production  plus  these are nt even made from recycled materials
__label__1 the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel  and is more userfriendly  i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application  which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print  some functionality as before  with some new organization and better look  feel
__label__0 i ve seen much better photos  articles on dylan and would not suggest this particular work  i will be selling my copy in the used section
__label__1 i really enjoyed this coloring book as in my very early yrs   i had kaleidoscopes to play with  i was always intriqued with the color spectrum in themi was hoping to find more on line with the illustrator of this book  sadly disappointed  will keep looking at other book sites  by the way  i am  yrs  old and i love to color  it s wonderful therapy for relaxing and bringing back some childhood fun
__label__0 after one year of owning this scale i replaced the batteries and it stopped working
__label__0 if you are buying this because you love rob  be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat  if you are nt familiar with this incarnationlet s just say it ai nt the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame  same guy  different sensitivity  i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there  on this outing  rob has met the enemy and it is himself  he s entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it  this cd is not an acquired taste  it is a forcedfeeding
__label__0 i should have listened to the other reviewers  i wanted to replace my c  drive with a faster one  and ghost  says it can do it  but do nt be fooled  even if you follow the extra steps from their support site  which are not in the documentation   you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors  it will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site  a friend recommended acronis trueimage which i ended using instead  it s much easier to use  copies about x faster than ghost  and best of all it works  i cloned and replaced c drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems
__label__1 this dvd teaches the history of tai chi  and the history of the  posture form and  posture form  it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style  and that now they are usually done for health improvement  then it shows the  posture form from the front  and the back  and with breathing instructions  im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements  but when i am  this is a great guide  it then shows each of the  postures  and their original martial art applications  which helps you have a strong intent during the posture  and keeps your arms and legs in proper position  then  it teaches the  posture form  step by step  with very detailed instruction  this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs  the dvd also shows the  posture form  which repeats several of the movements from the  posture form  and has other movements from other styles  it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the  posture form about  days a week on average  it has also improved my confidence  and people keep saying i have a glow about me  i just feel healthier  and happier too  this dvd is easy to learn from quickly  the chinese bamboo flute music is nice  oh  actually  my favorite part is at the end  it shows a  slideshow  of photos of the master  doing each posture movebymove  with great music  i like to do my form along to this section  because it is a bit slower than the actual form  and you can exactly match your movements to the master  its like having a oneonone class with him  i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly  i remember the form now  without having to  think   so i can try to turn my attention inward  a great dvd
__label__0 bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page  so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality  but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one  in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on  and in good lighting it is barely adequate  wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory cardshould have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer  you get what you pay for
__label__1 i was thrilled to see this available on cd  it is the most delightful christmas  album  of it s time  it continues to delight  i purchased several and gave to friends for christmas  every single receipient was immediately thrilled to have this  album  on cd stating   this was my favorite  where d you find it   great gift
__label__1 i have had other bath pillows that slid around or just were not comfortable  either itchy or not supportive at all  this pillow is just right  and nice and soft  and has nt gotten exceptionally dirty or moldy  which i was worried about
__label__1 its a cable  it works  what else do you want  i know its not the cheapest one out there  but this one says  sony  on it  yea   but  i am a true believer that you only get what you pay for  im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market  who knows  but i sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products
__label__1 definitely worth the money  for example  excel is a great program  it is pretty easy to use and not too hard to figure out  you can add up figures in a snap  this product provides a great service to companies because of the usefulness of this software
__label__1 i came across magix audio cleaning lab about  years ago  once i got the hang of it  i really liked it  however  i kept wondering if there were better programs out there  i mean  really  how good can it be for   right  i recently paid  for sony s famed sound forge studio  which is the sound forge program minus various some features   i spent a lot of time with sound forge studio  working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to cd  i was happy with what i was able to accomplish with sound forge  at least i thought i was happy  i compared my work in sound forge studio to the same cassette transfer i did with magix audio cleaning lab   the previous iteration of this software   guess what  i liked the magix work much better  so  i immediately purchased audio cleaning lab  and unintalled sony s sound forge studeio from my computer  magix could charge  for this software and i would buy it in a second  your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software  but it is worth the effort  this program does the work of software costing  times as much
__label__0 i love  the number one detective agency  series  and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales  unfortunately there was no narrative flow  making the stories stilted and uninteresting  maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped  i suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable
__label__0 i bought this as christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to italy this spring as part of a college course she is taking  and she will be spending a semister there next year as well  she just called me for school to help her resolve an error in the installation  the install reaches  then states it has encountered an error  and quits  it remains uninstalled and is thus far unusable  an awefully expensive piece of plastic that does nothing  as a senior software engineer i d have been fired for less  the rosettastone website  knowledgebase offers no information on this
__label__1 i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years  and i wo nt let any other soap touch my face  i found it when i was searching for a soap that would nt make my skin itch all over after a shower  i can tell you that after years and years  my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf  the soap is mild  with a neutral scent  which is a big plus  it cleans great  but does nt leave my skin dried out  the  ounce bars are a bit large  but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that s easier for us smallerhands people
__label__1 i have used onenote  for a couple of years now  and it is a fantastic program  onenote  is a very nice upgrade  it is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles  i have gone nearly paperless for my projects  i can pull in emails  web pages  graphics  scanned documents  ms office  and other  documents  screen clippings  a onenote feature   excel tables  links to files and web sites  etc onenote  adds a a better  more intuitive interface  and integrates better with outlook  eg  the tasks work together better  and other office programs   note  i sue outlook  at work and outlook  at home  and onenote seems to work fine with both   it also integrates better with windows mobile smartphones and pdas  onenote has a mobile onenote component that allows you to take notes on your pda  smratphone  and sync them with  unfiled notes  tab in onenote  a great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years

__label__1 fantastic pop up book  easy to keep the preschool children s attention when telling this story
__label__0 if you ve read anything already about these techniques  writing it down  visualizing it  tithing  this book offers no additional insights  and despite his  quot  official religious disclaimerquot  at the beginning of the book  it is packed to the rafters with the author s own religious dogma  if you share the author s religious outlook you may like this book  but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading
__label__1 this contains  servings  which means it will last you half a month  that s pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a  month supply of the flax capsules that costs  however  liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store  a flax oil pill typically contains mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of  times a day  so with pills you re getting g of flax oil a day  with liquid flax oil  you re getting g of flax  if you are buying this for it s purported treatment of acne  sunburn  diverticular disorders  hemorrhoids  and more serious health conerns  it s probably best to consume the liquid flax oil  if you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention  a pill a few times a day  combined with fish oil should be all you need  it s definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than  flax pills a day  and when you loook at value  you re getting g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical g in a  pill bottle of the capsules  it all depends on what you need it for
__label__0 this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks  loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit  but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous   lies my teacher told me  could have been an amazing book  but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a  page paper debunking half of what the author wrote  much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor  the only reason i did nt give the book  star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good  but the book as a whole is just far too biased
__label__0 worked well five times  then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean  as per instructions  then it would run before cutting  but upon trying to edge trim my moustache  it would stop immediately  as if a single hair could jam it  removing head  as required for cleaning  showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine  with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade  it appears that this plastic part s stability  shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement  a poor design that should nt have used plastic  do not bu

__label__1 all i needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my dell laptop  so i got acronis true image version  for half the price of the current version  i put the new hard drive  right off the sealed box  into a usb caddy that i got on ebay for   plugged it into the usb port  and ran acronis  selected the  clone drive  wizard  and less than an hour later it was done  no need to cross my fingers  the new drive booted right up  and i m using it now to write this review  what could be easier
__label__0 this is the first review i have written in probably a few years  normally  i do nt feel strongly enough about any product  good or bad  to bother entering a review  with this new version of quicken  i have something that i feel strongly enough to write about  i have been using quicken for close to  years  i have built all of my finances around it  for the past  years  quicken has been going steadily downhill  this latest version  i hope  represents rock bottom  i do nt see how the product could possibly get any worse  words cannot describe how bad this product is  no functionality has been added in the previous  years  what has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to quicken s  financial partners   and more redundant links to other  old  program features  and more white space  in return  the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only  screen  further  each screen refresh now takes seconds  whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous  entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate     even  complete screen refreshes  each one taking maybe  to  seconds  that means  once you hit the  enter  key to complete a transaction  you can be waiting as long as  seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction  as little as  years ago the same step required less than a second  obviously  time required will vary with your computer  but it is bad enough that quicken now requires you to  downgrade  your quicken software every few years  it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version  all of this with no additional features or functionality  there is a new kid on the block that i am switching to  it is called  moneydance   it can import data from quicken  it is fast  compact  and runs on any platform  windows  linix  unix  mac  even os   it is easier to use than quicken and the support is great  it is available for download  a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only  you can actually speak to a person to get help w  out having to pay  since i have been using quicken for years  it will take a while to test mondeydance out to make sure it works properly  i am running the  sidebyside for a while to make sure the numbers agree  so far  things are going well  then i plan to dump quicken forever  the well has run dry at quicken  everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company  obviously the people at quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want  but they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade  yet  that is what they are doing  i am absolutely positively through with quicken  and i am not coming back
__label__0 i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller  goes to show you some people have really bad taste  the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog  it seems like the author was being paid by the word  too much repetition  entire scenes which added nothing to the story  etc i would never purchase another book by this author  glad it s over and this ones in the trash can  charli
__label__1 if you ca nt get enough of zombie comedies this year  i seriously recommend this one  made in the czech republic of all places  i saw it at the tribeca film festival  ny  and it was tremendous fun  bloody  funny  and smart  an intellectual twist on the  secluded retreat  idea  a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives  and of course  they re overrun by zombies  i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gorefest  it works on so many different levels  while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral  your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes  the interesting characters  and the joyful way it plays with film conventions  this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic  i was disappointed that it did nt get a theatrical release in the us  so i m really glad that it s coming out on dvd  humor  horror fans will not be disappointed
__label__1 i recently purchased this camera and i m loving it  as a whole it s very easy to use and carry  i m a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera  i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time

__label__0 i m perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read  grapes of wrath  or  east of eden   instead i have focused on  of mice and men  and his lesser known works  such as  to a god unknown  and  my personal favorite   pastures of heaven   i ve been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular  when i began reading  in dubious battle   it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck s work  telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac  it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac s radical cell  there is a great  and misleading  sense of intrigue  mac and jim travel by boxcar  work secretly through letters  go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers  early on  the pace is fast  exciting  and engaging  suddenly  steinbeck simply fails to deliver  leaving the reader wondering when he s going to pick up the pace again  after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker s strike  i expected the sense of excitement to continue  it simply never does  summary of  in dubious battle   workers get mad  workers get tired  workers get mad  workers get tired  workers get mad  workers get tired  the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking  and talking  and talking  and talking  and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first  they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book  most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration  and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense  and eating  steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story  because at least a good  of the story concerns finding  eating  and  worst of all  talking about food  there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story  but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment  discussing whatever comes to mind  steinbeck s sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters  but i advise any reader of  in dubious battle  to take this course  after the strike is initiated  simply set the book down  you wo nt miss anything  nothing of great import happens  and only a very few memorable characters ever surface  and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces  i suppose now i ll give  grapes of wrath  a go  perhaps if it is nt one of his  greats   it is nt worth reading
__label__0 the topic of this book is very interesting  espionage in the revolutionary war  unfortunately   washington s spies  goes into so much nitpicking detail that  as the cliche goes  you ca nt see the forest for the trees  to really get anything out of this book  you d have to be a very dedicated revolutionary war buff  it did nt have much appeal at all to me as a general reader

__label__0 i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first  i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out  firstly  the bag is nice but does nt hold as much as i thought  it still could have worked for my but for one thing  this bag is not designed for those with a  erwomanly build  it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me  so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online  just a word of warning to the ladies
__label__0 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks
__label__0 im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately  think tony gayo   there are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore  all prodigy does is spit runon sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he s just there to be there  amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them  did we really have to hear this one to see that  if you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving
__label__1 i have been aware of naturallyspeaking for over  years  we initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood  more recently five years ago i bought edition  i found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so i basically quit using it  when i saw the  being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere  i thought i would try it one more time  being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better  only  minutes were required to set up the speechrecognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time  i never see that same misunderstanding happening again  i have recommended it to two friends who are buying it  it really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax  drink your coffee and dictate reports  answer email or whenever it is you might need to do  i ca nt think of any  expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time  i almost always have my headset on when i m in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data i used the dragondictate to do

__label__0 this camera will probably go down in nikon s history as one of its most overpriced and disappointing cameras  i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january  from the start  the colors never looked right  especially the ghastly magentatoned skin tones  i also bought the sbs   of them   thinking the cls would be a great addition  but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments  the camera has a wonderful feel  viewfinder and reasonably good controls  but the results are disappointing  the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition  canon  offers  nikon finally realized this and on dec  decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price    it just so happened mine was in melville  ny  with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty  these include bad af performance since upgrading to v of the firmware  bad color  overexposure  blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value  i would strongly suggest that you do nt buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers  indeed  forget nikon and go to canon
__label__0 norton is still the lb  gorilla of antivirus software  but i think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better  the old days when peter norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone  and these days norton is just a mass produced product of symantecs  customer service is through an internet database  and you must pay over  just to speak with someone even when norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in  the biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources  it is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on norton these days  i bought trend micro s pccillin and have not looked back  there product is less expensive and includes free phone support  and they have received all sorts of awards for their product

__label__0 i bought this camera after my yearold broke my kodak z i loved my z  even though it was only mp and did nt have a lot of the features the newer cameras have  i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to mp would be a nobrainer  but i was disappointed in  major areas  first  the lag time is so slow on the c  when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see  the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures  we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference  the other disappointing area was lowlight picture quality  anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit  every background was grainy  terrible  using the lowlight settings fixed the problem  but then your subject is blurry because you re not in  sports  or  kids  mode anymore  which we used all the time with the z for taking pics of the kids   on my z  which is only  now   i could set it and forget it  set it to  action   and it took perfect pics indoors  or out  moving or stationary  that s what i thought i was getting in the c  but i was wrong  i ended up returning the camera
__label__0 i have a compaq presario laptop with windows me  i wanted to upgrade it  so i decided to buy the windows xp upgrade  i have another computer that came with xp built in  and i like that system a lot  well  before i purchased this software  i specifically asked the manager at compusa if there are any problems upgrading from windows me to windows xp  i was very specific   no problem   he told me   it works great   nonsense  here is a list of hardware problems i had after loading windows xp onto the laptop   my touch pad stopped working   my pci bus started getting errors   my wireless network card  dlink gw  stopped working  and these are just the things i noticed in the first day of using it  i spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at microsoft  uninstalling and reinstalling the software  being put on hold  reinstalling drivers  restarting the computer over and over and over and over again  six extremely frustrating hours  finally  the tech support people told me to uninstall the software  they said i should return the software to compusa  now for the fun part  compusa refused to take it back    after arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great  all i got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product  then the manager said my system must not be compatible  well  i showed him the  system requirements  on the box  where it says  windows me   according to the box  my laptop is perfectly compatible  but apparently it s not  then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from me to xp  well  intyeresting he says that now  i reminded him about our conversation    i even gave the manager my microsoft case number so he could see for himself the problems i had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me  in the end  i am stuck with software that does not work  learn from my trials  do not buy this software if you have windows me  only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system
__label__1 the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenesthe plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as directorthis dvd is worth looking
__label__1 i wish i could give this book four and a half stars instead of four  i ca nt quite justify five stars in my mind  two of the stories were definitely good  the first   masked riders  by parhelion  and the third   ricochet  by ba tortuga  i enjoyed both  but was not particularly snowed by the intensity of the conflict  plot line or the main characters and their relationships  not so the second story   hung up  by cat kane was a powerful  intense and moving story about two delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their relationship up until they were able to work their ways  separately  around the issues  that story deserved a five stars plus rating and i wish kane would turn it into a full length novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more  this book is an excellent read both for the plot line and the erotic substance  enjoy

__label__0 it is hard to imagine what the american songbook ever did to rod stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this  not once  not twice  but three times  stewart s decision to approach these shopworn standards ranks up there with napoleon s decision to invade russia during the winter  it is staggeringly ill conceived  the problem  of course  is his voice  the selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer  which are countless  for starters  he has almost no range at all  next  his raspiness has no inherent beauty  and these are songs intended for beautiful voices  by their very nature  the selections are vehicles for skilled singers  their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective  stewart  because he is a rock and blues singer  never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature  expressive voice  he scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes  banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations   dolly parton    do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project  bear in mind that i like rod stewart  he s from scotland and he s the prototypical brit blues belter  if you want to know what he s actually good at  dig out your copy of jeff beck s first release  truth  stewart delivers some of the best blueeyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded  but that s the problem  on truth it was the cigarettes  whisky  and swagger in his voice that made him great  it was nt about singing technique  it was about authenticity  here  the focus is on singing  and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted  albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales  nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits  to be avoided at all cost

__label__0 certainly this album offers very little to a fan of the ocean blue s eariler work  the vocals and guitars sound quite different  gone is that beautiful dreamy sound   and what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun  just because steve lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether  so  anyway  what does this album offer instead  harder sounding guitar  angrier sounding vocals  and songs that are somewhat intersting  but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you ve had the cd for a couple weeks  exceptions   quot  whenever you re aroundquot   and  quot  slidequot  are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production

__label__1 first let me start off by saying this  ken sushi volume  is unquestionably the best video guide for making sushi  i have had a chance to see the other guides  and quite frankly they just do nt cut it  poor camera work  and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video  or any culinary instructional video for that matter   also  being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly  people want to learn from someone experienced  not enthusiastic   finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene  and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he s developed over the years  so that with a little practice  and the benefit of not having to take the time ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation  i was actually able to make some really great sushi  the camera work is great  no shakes or stutters  i did nt find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality  truthfully this video is done so well  you will just find yourself immersed in what ken is teaching  it plays a lot like a chef martin yan instructional video   also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation  yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome  delicious dish  if you take the time to watch the video a few times  and practice along with it  you will make sushi good enough to eat  and present to your friends  family  just utterly show off   i m just really glad i can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that i feel was worth every penny of my purchase  if you want to really learn how to make sushi well  then ken sushi volume  will be your number one resource  the only negative thing i have to say is where the heck is volume two
__label__0 what is remarkable about this onetime bestselling book   which could well be described as a comingofagewithoutcomingofage novel   is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of  nope  the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced  the great gatsby  a mere five years later   this side of paradise  is a mess  it is as uneven  affected  feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero  the tiresomely selfconscious young minnesotangonetoprinceton amory blaine   one suspects  in fact  that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled thirdperson narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory s diary the result would have been considerably more readable   or the book s structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable  at least   that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in    it was to prove the most popular book  in terms of sales  ever produced by its author   presumably speaks to the public s recognition of something new and revealing in it  okay  amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype  and the drinking and shameless smooching  etc  that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably  one can accept  a revelation to see in print  and likely a titillating one  for an american audience raised on mcguffy s readers   and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war  welp  here it comes   on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon  the  petting party   none of the victorian mothersand most of the mothers were victorianhad any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed   to the reader at a remove of some plus years this is  of course  very small beer  what was alarming frankness in  tends to read now  in the best cases of the paradise narrative  as unalarming quaintness  while this is not exactly fitzgerald s  fault   so to speak  it is also true that the use of  shocking revelations  of this type   scandals specific to a place and time   represents a risk a writer takes  the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and  or universal in such episodes  in any event  the price the reader pays here  in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory s adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties  is very  very high for payoffs of such modest proportions  i mean  come on   for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart  the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds  he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore  and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it  eleanor was  say  the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty  the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes   yikes  i do nt care what new generation you re talking about  can a flakepounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody   can it represent anything to anybody   there are things to like  even admire  here and there in paradise  fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark  eg   they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered    sometimes i wish i d been an englishman  american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy    it s better to leave the blustering and tremuloheroism to the middle classes  they do it so much better    and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator s observations is  in its nowcurious way  refreshingly  bracingly funny   slowly and inevitably  yet with a sudden surge at the last  while amory talked and dreamed which is about all amory ever doesmht  war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played  every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings  when amory went to washington the next weekend  he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back  for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliensgreeks  he guessed  or russians   nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there s a war on  i always say  anyway  most of the novel consists of young amory s elaborate ponderings   romantic  philosophical and egotistical   which are as forgivable as they are forgettable  i ve forgotten them already  at some level  in any case  fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character   who was  of course  a notverydisguised version of himself  for how else  if not as commendably selfdeprecating irony  are we to take this observation   amory was in full stride  confident  nervous  and jubilant  scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do  so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him  and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirtysix hours   in the end  in any event  one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder  in paradise almost nothing works  form  content  narrative stance  dialogue  character development  pacing   you name it  it s a problem  yet in gatsby  five years later  everything works   everything  if there is to be a great american novel  it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor  while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b  the fact is that he did   and without point a the journey could not have begun  so while  this side of paradise  hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon  it surely deserves our respect  and indeed our gratitude  for what it led to

__label__0 i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena  however  i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created  there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition  the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me  i disagree with the simplistic conclusion  among others  that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china
__label__0 this item is advertised as boufant and oversized  it is anything but  the shower cap is so tiny  it would fit on a grapefruitthis kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line
__label__0 this movie is a dud  who d have thought that john wayne and the director of  support your local sherrif  would have joined forces for this stinker  the characterization hints at being good  but really its character actors doing what they do best  being good support characters  its a good thing to because the duke really just mailed this one in  first  what this movie does well  ann margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy  the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show  it is interesting that the bad guys chasing ann margaret and john wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end  when you get to the end  you learn why  but it works well to keep them faceless  the last  minutes is good  top notch with a twister of an ending  however  what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right  john wayne is absolutely uninspired  he is just a cardboard version of himself  a cranky  mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character  and when they do  it seems very  very clunky  at least  minutes of this movie consists of longdistance shots of people riding horses  sometimes  they ride over hills  sometimes they ride through valleys  we get  separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the rio grande  the border with mexico   fill in this time with some character development  some dialogue  anything  the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie  all in all  it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so john wayne could have another movie in the theaters  too bad  a crack team of writers could have made it something special  my suggestion  get  cowboys  or either of the two  rooster cogburn  movies or  support your local sherrif  and see this actor and this director doing much better work
__label__0 ok  maybe a  star is actually fair since my nose does nt smudge the lcd screen as much  the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera  both my d and rebel xt  if i am lucky enough it will fall off  get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory
__label__0 be advised  this software is for a single user  only licensed for one computer  i bought this for home use after using ss for  years and vcom said it would no longer be supported of    i installed it on  home computers  it worked fine for  weeks  then it popped up a box on my second computer that i couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer  i needed to buy additional license for each computer  when i tried to use it on my main computer  it popped up the same message  so now it will not work on either computer  i uninstalled it and sent it back  just because it s cheap does not mean it s any good
__label__1 pros  compact and complete  this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it s reversible backdrop  gray  blue   i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well  construction quality is good  i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel  which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs   sturdy enough for its intended purpose  i like the output of the lights seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight  cons  only one complaint  the output of the lights could be stronger  requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture
__label__1 this is by far my  year old son s favorite book and he has lots of them  whenever it s time to read to him he says  quot  toot tootquot  and i know that means he wants to have this book read to him  sometimes several times in a row  the illustrations are wonderful  and there is all sorts of stuff going on if you look closely  an all around great  fun book  i highly recommend this book
__label__1 my little boy who is  years old loves this movie  he goes around acting like the characters from the movie  he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending  he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness  and let harold win the next time  this is a great movie  with a young michael j  fox in it  and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
__label__0 card studio  has repeated many cards from card studio  i bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed  also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched  you have to pick a card in order to read the front  very time consuming
__label__0 five stars for the movie one star for this dvd because it is missing the key scene when clara talks to her parents in their bedroom after marty drops her off  the dvd cuts from clara putting her key in the door to marty walking to the bus stop  why the scene is cut i have nt a clue
__label__1 it s easy to use and makes good pictures  easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait  i also have a gb san card so i can shoot up to almost  pictures  as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via email
__label__0 i bought this dvd for my grandson because he loves airplanes and trains  too much commentary and very little action shots of trains and airplanes  it did not keep his interest  a total waste of money
__label__1 this program is dependable and adequate within the limits that it is avertised to do  for instance  it wo nt keep track of inventory  since it was not designed to do so
__label__1 this is a wondrful cd and quite a bargin  two discs and the very best of nancy wilson  i liked so much  i bought two and gave one to a friend
__label__1 are you looking for a way to get your kids into the kitchen  turing out tasty projects  i know i was and i went through about fifteen  kids  cookbooks at the local bookstore before i stumbled on this little gem  it was the only cookbook  other than the everything kid s cookbooks  that would actually get a child into the kitchen  the projects are appealing on all levels they are easy to assemble  they are too cute for words  and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions  it also has a good balance of entrees to deserts  unlike some of the family cookbooks i ve reviewed  and with the desserts like cookies it takes one basic recipe and shows you about four different ways to use it marvelous  it s also pantry friendly no star fruit or rare ingredients you do nt have laying around  now if you re looking for a kids cookbook to vary your family s fare  then keep in mind this is a slender picturebook sized volume you wo nt find more than  projects in the whole book  for a good standard family cookbook  i recommmend beyond mac  n  cheese by mops  but if you are looking to get your kids   and under  into the kitchen to spend some time together having fun at the counter  then do nt hesitate to buy this little gem  it is my number one recommendation for children s cookbook  projectwise  for the above twelve set  i recommend the everything kid s cookbook because it is a little more geared towards meals and has crossword puzzles and fun foods that are meant to be played with  if you are looking for a cookbook with tons of recipes that will appeal to your family  be pantry friendly and save you money  check out  cheap  fast  good
__label__0 after purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my presario running xp home all i get is a message that ssp has unexpectedly quite  i emailed tech support w  the info  but so far no response after  days  there is no  to call for support  maybe i overlooked something  also  i submitted the rebate form which came on the package  but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and i need to check w  them  i did and they said they shipped what vcom had provided them  which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade  not very impressed w  either the software or the company  would never buy another product from these guys  even when the price after rebate is  lof
__label__0 the e is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed  you must have the camera s zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens  so this means if the subject is moving around a lot  such as my daughter playing soccer  you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you ca nt zoom out  as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful  i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off  etc another negative is that the viewfinder does nt show the zoomed in image  you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot  which can be difficult in bright sunlight
__label__0 i paid top dollar for ps and thought it was time to upgrade to cs after i installed cs i discovered that i could not crop any photo without having my pc crash  every time it crashed i looked at the defrag utility and i had fragmented files all over the place  then i defraged the hard drive and went back to cs and tried to crop the same photo again  again  my pc hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said i had to defrag  the only thing i did was to crop one photo in cs  and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again  i uninstalled this piece of garbage from my pc  it does not work  and i do nt care what deke mcclelland says and i do nt believe what he says  either  save your money  these ripoff artists at adobe are nothing but thieves  yeah  they ripped me off for  but you know what  at least i have my integrity  and that s more than you got  deke baby
__label__1 as an emergency nurse practitioner and paramedic  i cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest  technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac arrest victim earlier and earlier   and the survival rates and quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing accordingly  is there too much directtoconsumer marketing by medicalrelated companies  probably  is your personal risk for experiencing sudden cardiac arrest per calendar year low  definitely  but do those smug reviewers refuse to buy vehicles with airbags in them just because their risk of being in an accident is low and the directtoconsumer marketing is irritating to them  no  those will be the same folks who want their cars with antilock breaks  airbags  the best sideimpact reinforcements  and being a good driver  ie   just improve your diet   wo nt cancel their risk for being in an accident  i hope you never have to use this machine  but as an emergency healthcare worker   both prehospital and in the emergency room   i cannot say enough positive about aed s in the community setting  do nt run out and purchase this out of paranoia  however if yuo are at risk for a sudden cardiac event consider if this would be appropriate for you  your family members  your apartment building  your church  etc and rest assured that it is absolutely safe   it is impossible to hurt a loved one with this  you can only help  and to those who gave negative reviews on this aed  do nt forget to pay your car insurance
__label__0 this os is not for any ordinary user  if you know nothing about drivers  peripherals  etc  then do nt get this os  lots of incompatability issues  i thought this os would make my gaming experience better  apparently it needs lots of work  ca nt play css  day of defeat  lord of the rings online  etc bf and some other games play slower in vista compared to xp  i hardly write reviews  but i just want everyone to know that this os suxs  stay with xp pro sp games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on xp  it is nt worth getting right now  wait a year or two until it gets worked out  feels like beta  which it shouldnt  microsoft  you get a f  for your new os  you fail  nice try
__label__1 for the money  you absolutely ca nt beat this lens  it s very fast and sharp  not fast to focus  but what do you expect at   i have four lenses  some costing x s as much as this oneyet i use this one the most  anyone looking to step up from the kit lens  or anyone looking to buy a camera body w  out the kits lens should look to buy this lens
__label__1 the ultimate edition of this movie  lots of extras and the image and sound are great
__label__1 i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated  there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted  but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly  ex one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static   the costumes were well selected  but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard  you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face   this version follows the book well  though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the  drink me  bottle  i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film  i recomend this to fans and people who are nt overly critical of films
__label__1 david lean s  the bridge on the river kwai  like jean renoir s  grand illusion  is an antiheroic war film  set in a prisoner of war camp environment  but there  the point of resemblance came to an end   the bridge on the river kwai  is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored  and if in  grand illusion  the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity  in  the bridge on the river kwai  they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up  escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma  the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards  the camp commander is a rigid psychopath  conditions are hard to bear  psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration  into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson  alec guinness in a fascinating performance   a strict  serene  dedicated british officer  deeply concerned for the welfare of his men  nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito  sessue hayakawa  for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge  nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him  but his obsession has risen to nearmadness  he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge  and in his determination to find victory in defeat  he ignores that the bridge  which he insists must be a  proper bridge   will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops  in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture  captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code  a third element  in the story  is introduced  a small commando team led by major warden  jack hawkins  and an american sailor  william holden  whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge  the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax  a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal  the brige of the river kwai  each character  in the motion picture  has a valid reason for what he is doing  and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane   the bridge on the river kwai  hits with  war  in a compelling logic of events  the indulgence of selfdestruction  with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march   the bridge on the river kwai  is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men
__label__1 the shampoo does nt lather  but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day  and it seems to be doing it s job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itchfree since i started using it  so i would recommend it
__label__1 sept th   i bought this for my goddaughter after buying mia s science adventure  i have never been so impressed with a companies product before  you can learn both spanish and french on the same cd  the graphics are amazing  the adventure is stupendous and now lily  my goddaughter  is learning spanish  her level is above all her classmates and she s even started conversing with a mexican girl in our neighbourhood  well worth your money
__label__1 it is almost like dream comes true when i saw the revised  new second edition out at the bookstore  the imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor  but has graciously added new  updated materials in synthesis  you may see it as an equivalent to jerry march s advanced organic chemistry but a whole different approach  the sections on oxidations  reductions  and organoboranes are excellent  since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field  not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry  use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like nicholaou s classics in total synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry
__label__1 this is  i believe  the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band  it begins with a nice quick paced tune   second hand news  and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there  the album itself does not have a bad tune on it  in fact  of all the  regular  albums from fleetwood mac  excluding greatest hits compilations   this album has more hits on it than any other  hits like  dreams    never going back    do nt stop    go your own way    the chain  and  you make loving fun   all of these get enormous radio play  moreover   dreams  was a number one hit  and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end  and has sold over  million copies in the us and over  million worldwide  putting into the top  best selling albums of all time  in fact  an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america s youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell  rumor  there would inevitably be two  us  in the spelling  now that is a very strong impact on culture  every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album  one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album   never going back  which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock s premier guitarists  lindsey buckingham  and  in my opinion  the best christine mcvie song ever written   songbird   now  with this release  you can also get  on a second cd  the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album  this makes for great listening  to hear how the songs developed and were recorded  moreover  early demos are included along with two  jam sessions   now  more than ever  this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music  or music in general for that matter   if you are a fleetwood mac fan  then chances are you own this album  but if you are just getting introduced to the band  then you must buy this cd  i highly recommend it
__label__1 i enjoy all the features of this item  the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure  you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off  the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear  the slot for memory cards   depends on the card type   batteries  roomy for four aa   and cables can fit in it  the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy  it s not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good  the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width  it can even handle the worst environment ever  hot  dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops  it has protected my dig  camera very well
__label__1 after reading the reviews here and at  on this baby  i was a little cocerned about its lowlight and indoor performance  let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded  yes  if you film in very low light  it will darken many colors  but we re talking  lux  which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake  just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles  and viola  seriously  i have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors  outdoors  or even when i film local bands playing in dark bars  the reason i wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flashbased camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews  i do not want a tape mechanism that will break  nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many filmworthy conditions  think snow skiing  as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather   as i said  i was skeptical when i purchased it  but no more  the videos are far better than any other camcorder i ve owned  my last was a canon zr  mini dv  and this camera takes vastly superior videos than that one  the four stars is only because of the mpeg format this records to  i have a mac  so editting requires that i convert to dv with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies  mainly  i just do nt edit my home videos so that has nt been a problem  but if would have been nice for it to be an easier option  and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg with h and mp  aac  which appears to be the next standard  if that concerns you  or if you want hd  you might wait until the panasonic sd is available because it records in avhdc which is a form of mpeg of course  imovie does nt yet support that either  so you may have to wait until ilife  to really use it  in parting  i will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous  i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera  this thing literally fits in my jacket pocket  so i end up filming a lot more than i did with previous cameras  if you re looking for small  flashbased  and good quality video  get this camera  you ll love it
__label__1 too bad this group supported by keith sweat did nt go any further  i bought it for one song  but the whole cd is great for listening  lyrics contain songs about love and such  and i like they way speak about it  it gives you something to look forward to
__label__0 the nikon camera s is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture  it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk
__label__0 i loved the camera  absolutely loved it  i was using it one night and it died  i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened  the light on the charger did nt flash or the camera did nt even go in after dying  the second time i used it  i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger  i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures  as i was looking at the pictures  it just shut off  i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose  i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine
__label__1 i purchased this dvd because it said it was an easier pilates video to do  basically anyone  even beginners  could do it  i have to disagree  i started this video and tried to do all of the   ten minute sections  it was nt completely hard  but definitely challenging  i am not the most fit person  but also not the most unfit  i had a harder time because i am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video  i am not saying i would nt suggest it  i am just saying it s not definitely for beginners  however  the instructions are clear and since it s broken up into the fiveten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it
__label__1 lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist  ready if needs be  to question cherished assumptions  one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory  where he initially states  as he sees it  the five big problems in physics  in this context  he makes the very important point that since the end of the  s there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and  in particular  he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough  in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics  but then he builds up his case against the theory  he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model  probably the most successful theory in physics  but even predicts particles not seen in nature  it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy  nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions  in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics  he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory  he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed  but notes that this theory  m theory  still remains a tantalizing conjecture  he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded  this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes  are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader  indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says  we are missing something big  there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough  that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the  murk  into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature  the clues are there  to do this  lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed  he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not  and whether it is  lateral  thinking or a breakthrough revolution in  conceptual  thinking  new thinking is definitely required  lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that  he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation  a good choice perhaps  i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book  if they have not already done so
__label__0 we have kid pix  and my kids      played it all the time  we just  upgraded  to kid pix   and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning  kid pix  runs in x resolution but it wo nt force your screen resolution to match that when it runs  kid pix   of course  did  as we are using a lcd monitor with native resolution of  x   we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution  so now we are faced with  options    use kid pix  with a drastically reduced window  the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top  or   adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program  i find this unacceptable  customer support is nonexistent  if you bought it retail  the learning company wo nt answer your questions and refers you to encore s website  no patches are available and encore has no way to actually contact them  their faq simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to x i think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release  boo to encore  boo to tlc for allowing their  brand  to be junked  boo to broderbund  do nt waste your time

__label__0 despite the fact that hanegraaff s name is the bigger of the two on the front cover  only the first  pages of this very small book are worth reading  and they are the writing of paul maier  his research is helpful  but so limited in scope that you wonder if he was nt given a weekend to write it and come up with as much as he could  every topic needs futher information  a lot more could be said  and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more  hanegraaff contributes  pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surfacelevel reworking of information covered much better elsewhere  that said  i would give this book to someone who is nt much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions  it is nt much more than a collection of scattered soundbites  but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction
__label__1 everything that i ve made so far has been really really good  recipes are easy to follow and pack up nicely for next day lunches
__label__0 this series may be good for a laugh  some of the writing is engaging  but the premise is absurd  why  in this day and age  should anyone accept the worldview of the bible  a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves  stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe s beliefs  and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt sinai  in a sense  bible believers have been  left behind  since the s enlightenment  tom paine s  the age of reason  showed the god of the bible to be a cruel  vindictive monster  and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations   the ravings of a madman   read this series  if you like  enjoy parts of it  but make no mistake  to take any of this seriously  you have to regress to a prehistoric worldview  before men learned to think  to ask questions  before logic or science   a time when dazed  superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth  if they did nt grovel humbly enough to their supposed god  do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one  when the  sheep  are raptured up to heaven  their clothes are left behind  so heaven is a nudist colony  the basic contradiction  of course  lies in using worldly action  some of it exciting  to proselytize for the unworldly  the supernatural  but why should we care whether any of the  good  guys gets killed  and why should they mind   wo nt they go straight up to heaven  that s what they want  is nt it  why even lift a finger against the  bad  guys   did nt christ say   resist not evil   worried about who will win   god  is infinitely powerful  so jesus  who is    of god   or something like that  is sure to win when armageddon rolls around  in book  of the series  and the  sheep    the believers   will happily worship him  looking just like the pictures of dimwitted  bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah s witnesses leave at your door  the going price for a used copy of  tribulation force  is one cent  does that tell you something  actually  the storytelling is worth more  the basic premise is worth less  perhaps it averages out
__label__1 i have had this bag for a year and recommend it  i use it all the time  it s a great walkaround bag  the first time you re in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or do nt want to put your bag down you ll appreciate the sling design  just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time  my only error was getting the   i should have gone with the   and plan to do so  i like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room  i d also found that i need a little more room for noncamera things  a word on the allweather cover  a great feature  a few weeks ago i was in bermuda and walked to a beach about  minutes away  just as i arrived a soaking rain began that did nt let up for the entire walk back  if i had nt been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked  now i would nt buy a bag without one

__label__0 i bought this program because i wanted to use it on the pocket pc  dell axim xv   the program is very confusing to use  it took some time to load on the ppc first  then you have to load the maps  i tried to load the map of the whole state and it was nt working  the map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where i was  but when i would write an address of a street that exists  it would say  search done  no match found   i called the delorme support many times  they helped me go through the application  but i feel that this application wont give me directions that i want off of the ppc  i should have bought the iguidance  one of my friends has this application and it is awesome  he loaded  states all at once and it gives you directions very easily  there are many points of interest  i particularly like the screen that shows you all the streets in a d fashion  it is easy to use   do nt make the mistake that i made  buy the iguidance or tomtom software
__label__0 just show the real machines working  forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and does nt even hold my son s interest  he much prefers the fred levine series or the i love cat machines series

__label__0 i gave this a nd star for a support call ms provided  if you do have a frontpage server  and have it set  on   it had some advantages over ftp  i bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures  i ve used  programs for creating galleries over the years  i think a perl script using linux  mogrify worked best  this works worst  the free ones w  the digital cameras beat it  frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos  a next  previous button  you can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic  colage type thing  once you expand it  you must remember the shot you were on  back up  and then click on the next one  unbelievable  i know what i need for handling photos efficiently  flicr has it  crosstab indexing of the same photo  i think picassa is close and getting closer  this was nt worth the cost of picassa  free
__label__0 here s one more a to add to the ever increasing list of e failures  thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i m not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired  the camera is only about  years old  guess i ll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits  the camera really performed nicely when it was working  thus the  stars  hope you have better luck than me if you get one
__label__0 i just purchased the hallmark card studio      everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card  the first side printed fine  but when printing the next side i keep getting the  this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down   i have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far  i have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed  i am running windows se  i will probably be returning this to the store  if possible   it looked to have some nice cards on it  which is basically all i wanted it for  but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer
__label__1 having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series  the following are my suggestions   read all five books in order  the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context  think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal  dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable  getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a    page experience   read the oxford university editions  there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events  when you read    pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight  the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter   if you really like any one book in particular  go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection  i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir  the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable  along with sir walter scott  alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel  i have been reading these types of novels my entire life  beyond a doubt  alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre
__label__1 compare to the price of the product i highly recommend to any one who own canon eos camera
__label__1 after trouble and his austin city limits appearance  i thought he was just another very good singer songwriter  this follow up has made me reconsider  because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist  he waited and it was worth the wait  this reminded me immediately of john lennon  please do nt punish me for blasphemy  and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way  i did nt expect something this deep for a sophomore recording  enjoy
__label__0 i could nt finish this book after readng  fairytale   misfit insecure caucasian male falls for asian stripper  prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets  i thought possibly this story reveals a lot about olen butler  he wrote about this relationship with such relish  he sounds to me like a pc caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the  otherness  of asian people and does nt see them for what they are  just wants them to appreciate big strong white man  i thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother  so she was not honest with him  but olen butler wrote about her as if this stripper  pros  was wonderful  the kind of wife any man would want  i shook my head and thought   you have issues   probably if she were caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something  after this the other stories just did not appeal to me
__label__0 my wife got this for me for christmas  i was thrilled and thought it was a great idea  i charged the device and transferred pictures to it  i work in technology  so i agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible   to delete any photos  you have to delete them from the device  not the software  image quality is ok  but not good enough to be  sharing  with people  and after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them  it got a bit old  other than looking at it  straighton   nobody on either side of you can see the image  it s backlit  which is finebut it does nt help much  unfortunately  the battery did nt last all that long  the device refused to charge after about two months  and eventually it died altogether  the only way to make the unit work was to plug in the usb cable  the battery would not charge  so i contacted  support  and got a basic runaround  telling me that you  should nt charge the battery for more than  hours  at a time  and that i could request an rma to return it for replacement  warranty is no good  and it ca nt be returned  i m holding onto it because i ll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop  photocube   so it can run off the usb cable  but i agree with others that   even if this worked longer than  months   it s just a novelty that gets tedious quickly
__label__0 i agree with m arse with the star rating  i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning  not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light  i m interested in the  mp camera canon offers  i ve read that it has much better shutter speed  recommended
__label__1 this book covers all the elements of game theory  emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism  the philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment  the  appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key concepts such as the minmax theorem  the geometry of equilibria and linear programming  the book has not changed much since its publication in   but it is by no means archaic  even for those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook   quot  games and decisionsquot  is highly recommended as a supplement  there is something for everyone in it
__label__1 i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were  heisenberg s uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned  hawking made it seem like common sense  hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times  and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points  just in case you missed them    but allinall  this was a quite readable account of what s presently known about cosmology  i use the term  presently  guardedly  as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter  it exists    but from now on  when there are new findings in physics  i want hawking to explain them to me  because i feel like then i might understand them  that s why you should read this book  the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life  and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical  this was still a hard read  and i feel like i grasped maybe  of it  for you to decide  but for a former engineering student  this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics

__label__0 i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool  but ended up disappointed  they definately oversell it as an interior design tool  looking at the brochure online  i really think they must have touched up the images  because i do nt see any way that they could have created them with this product  as a matter of fact  the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that  the reason i do nt give it  star is that the video tutorial section is really great  i wish all software had that
__label__0 this book does nt make any sense  it is so  so  so boring  the book is not well written  and the sentences are way too short  i woud nt recommand this book to anyone
__label__1 i discovered seal the same way that most people did  through his utterly beautiful song  kiss from a rose   i heard it on the radio one day  and played it constantly for months after that until i finally decided to purchase the album the song was from  as it happens  the song is from seal s most revered album  his multiplatinum  selftitled album   this is not to be confused with his other selftitled album  his debut  released in   i did nt know what to expect when i bought the album  having heard only one song from it  but months after purchasing it i m glad i made the gamble  i think that the subgenre which best classifies seal is urban  urban music  according to all music guide  is smooth and polished  often romantic  sometimes uptempo and funky  and features soulful vocals  seal has all of this and more  it has techno beats  but they re not as overwhelming as one might expect  they blend together with peaceful  occasionally ethereal guitars and seal s incredibly soothing singing  this is  no doubt  stylish music  but first and foremost it s a collection of warm  encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician  there s nothing that comes close to being a bad song here  there s not even a slightly weak composition  thus it s a little harder to pick highlights than usual  some highlights include the strong opening track   bring it on   the emotional hit  prayer for the dying   the shimmering  dreaming in metaphors   the upbeat  newborn friend   and  needless to say  the absolutely wonderful  kiss from a rose   the closing track   bring it on  reprise   is another beautiful song  but  kiss from a rose  is possibly the most lovely song i ve ever heard  listening to it in the warmth of one s home during a snowy december afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience  the message of the album  if there is one  is  keep on going  life is beautiful   it could fail under any other popular artist  but seal succeeds marvelously  this is some of the most heartfelt  inspirational singing i ve ever heard  there s a delightful optimism in seal s singing that sounds strong rather than naiive  it s hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this  seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of rb  or rock  you decide   these songs have clear  strong messages  warm  inspirational lyrics  heartfelt  soothing singing  danceable beats  and a whole lot of emotion  once you ve heard  kiss from a rose   i guarantee you ll want to pick up the album  if you re already thinking of doing so  then i encourage you to go forward and buy it  you wo nt regret it  it s become one of my favorite albums  when you re feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general  look no further than seal to make you cherish it once again
__label__0 synopsis  including ending   don ameche  gino   a chicago shoe shine man  is approached by the mafia to go to jail for   to  years  to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him  they ll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat  joe mantegna  jerry  takes don ameche  gino  on a  day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he s incarcerated  joe mantegna is on probation from the mob  after disobeying orders from a previous job  joe mantegna goes  outside channels  to take don ameche  gino  to lake tahoe to the  galaxy  hotel where they stay  wine and dine  and try to have a good time  things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche  gino  to his house as a guest and they form a bond  the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle  they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago  joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide   it s cleaner this way    he s told  joe mantegna refuses the order  and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for  years to life  the good  joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe  other than that  there s nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge  the bad  the mob wants tough guys  right  this is a comedy  right  no ones a tough guy and there s no laughs  joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy  don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality  i wanted to like this film but i coulde nt because it was very slow  very boring and none of the characters were interesting  we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet  you would expect a friendly  thanks for going to jail for  to  years for me  but it does nt happen  at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he s testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail  he does nt look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet  he s right there taking the fall  if the film did nt need to depend on don ameche s appearance  why did nt they send him to jail from the beginning  the worst david mamet experience i ve had  very surprising stinker  the characters  if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting  if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them  he would have been more interesting  as the film stands  they re both flat  don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used  when a character says something  you can be sure don ameche repeats it  minutes later like a senile robot  don ameche s dialogue leaves a lot to be desired  add to that his boring and stale acting in this film  he played very dumb  not interesting  like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money  overall  joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand  don ameche was too passive and uninteresting  and joe mantegna is too passive and stale  scene criticism  a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic   gas station scene where joe mantegna is given  more in gas than he asked for  joe mantegna is working for the mob  and he asks for  of gas  and gets  he does nt have the cash to pay  and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is  please  please  please  a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant  take back the keys  and leave for the plane they were late for  a mob guy that wo nt defend himself for    scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for  to  years  don ameche does nt put up a fight or try to leave the room  and is too passive  we do nt learn about his past or his life or family  there s not enough time spent on the offer  and the scene was over valued for it s lasting value   bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape  joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche s character to justify the scene  instead it s  strangers  personal commentary  the test for a comedy for me is   how many times did i laugh   this film never made me laugh  i m shocked the film costs  on dvd  rent it instead  it belongs in the  bin at walmart  writing criticism  lines like  he s the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy  and lines like  a big man knows the value of a small coin  and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense  the writing is drivel  alternative recommended film   trading places  with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche  albeit in a smaller role
__label__0 we have had this camera for about a year  we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake  the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working  we have a canon powershot a as well and have been very happy with the performance  i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone

__label__1 undoubtedly  marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann s best film scores  a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock s underrated movie  written for small ensemble  strings  woods  harp and horns  herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood  tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch  joel mcneely s reading is simply stunning as ever  so is the performance  but i just do nt like the overall acoustics on these varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details  they simply are overheard in this muffled sound  this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this  but  it s a great  great score

__label__1 truly the author s pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas  parents  children  evangelical christians from kentucky  television  macy s  the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war  and  keeping up with the joneses   this short book is much funnier than his bestselling  me talk pretty some day  as the author s humorous cynicism is at its best  one ca nt put it down for fear of missing some insight into the american psyche  three of the stories appear to be autobiographical  with obvious changes made to  protect the innocent   wherein the author  tells  the others in the guise of another  regardless  sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches  even if there s a little guilt attached to that feeling
__label__1 i bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it  it has all the basic functions her older coolpix had abut more and they re a bit more user friendly  pros  compact and easy to hold  i ve had a few other point and shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand  this one feels pretty good  cons  before buying i read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be  i will agree  that is the cameras only real big down fall  though my girlfriend may not notice it so much  to me it s a little more aparant  for the most part  overall i really like this little guy
__label__0 i hate to admit i actually own this thing on vhs  and unless my mind is going more than usual  i have this cut of the movie too  double  and more  dipping by the studios seems to be the way of dvd  we get at least four issues of terminator   but none of robinson crusoe on mars  i personally am sick of it  director s cuts  unrated editions  and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet  no wonder i ve taken to borrowing nearly all my dvds from the public library  no  you generally do nt get them the day they come out  but honestly  when was the last time you purchased a movie from hollyweird that was worth keeping  do nt do it
__label__0 remember the days when we were punks and we d gather  round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders  they held up to  minutes of music  count  em   minutes  then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him  including myself  he was quite the singer  when i was a young kid though  the only form of music we had were the concerts  i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert  quite an amazing virtuoso  and johann strauss jr conducting his orchestra  those were the days  then they came out with those things called grammophones  which were even more modern  if it was even possible  but it was  because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to  lazy kids  i mean  you did nt even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones  and what s this   hour  a full  minutes of music  on  record  pshaw   minutes of music was all i needed  and i was still pooped out even after that  in my day  it was bed at  pm  breakfast at  am  then off to the mines  we did nt have  minutes of free time  i have no idea what form of music they have now  appearently  they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph  now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eyepods    and mp  mp players  whatever they re called  listening to that  hiphop  tomfoolery of theirs  you ca nt even call it music  it s just noise  well  gotta get ready for bed now  it s almost

__label__0 after owning three other canon cameras i am through with canon  all my other cameras were fine  this cameras lcd broke within the first month of normal use  never dropped  all of my other digital cameras held up for years  ive had two powershot ss  lost and  stolen  never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times  this is a product defect  design flaw and canon will not cover it under warranty   to get it repaired and it will happen again  or you may start getting the e errors  this is a expensive paperweight  poor design  very dissapointed  i will never buy another canon product again
__label__1 i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd it is here  a very good movie  i have to say the inspector carson  belonging to an unknown federal agency   character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting  he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate  his lines in the movie  particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan  kris kristofferson  discuss  politics  during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best  the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra  great bit part acting by rip torn  roberts blossom  as the desert rat   tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart  kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well  anyone who has been in law enforcement or any other supervisory capacity for that matter has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol  totally inept  the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes  a must see movie
__label__0 i do nt know where amazon got these cases of all small  mighty  free clear  i use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it  from my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo  the amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint  it also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version  at the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout  the amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a nondripless spout  at first i called the manufacturer  their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call  so i decided to use it  i do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes  i would not purchase this again from amazon  the price is not that great to overcome the odd differences  i will  however  continue to purchase this product from my local retailers

__label__1 i recently recieved my new camera  and i am thrilled  i have been researching which camera to buy since december  when our last camera went capoot   there have been mixed reviews for the olympus sw series  but could not resist the appeal of this camera s unique features  i cannot wait to take it into the pool this summer with the kids  so far  the point and shoot options and pictures have been lovely  any person can screw up pictures with any camera  but this camera has so many features to avoid that  my husband and i had a wonderful time taking extreme close up shots of our garden  i have not seen that quality  and had that much satisfaction from a camera since we first switched over to digital  i am very pleased  to say the least  with this purchase

__label__1 millionaire fredrick loren played by a young vincent price invites five strangers to a party in the house on haunted hill  with his delectable wife annabel in tow  he has set the strangers a task of sorts  if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them    each  however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer  the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted  one of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing  at midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next  and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the house on haunted hill takes on a life of its own  but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun  i enjoyed this film  it was nt overly suspenseful  but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then  the special effects were noneexistent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house  all in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same
__label__1 i m pleased with the purchase  i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad  i spent six months in england  with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt  it s very sturdy if nothing else  between the trains  planes  hostels  and general bustle i m very pleased with how well it held up  nothing on it broke  i probably took at least  pictures during my trip  if not more  sure i ve had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i ve had it  but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well  the zoom on this camera is very nice  it s one of the better zooms i ve seen on a simple camera of this type  or at least it was back when i bought it  it also has several features that older film cameras do not  such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture  or settings to take  portraits  or  night shots   i know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras  i know that it does nt have all the frills of the new digital cameras  and i am not trying to compare it to those  i m not a professional photographer  so i do nt know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot  i do nt want a digital for personal and professional reasons  for a traditional film camera  this one is the best i ve ever used  bottom line  good quality photos  a sturdy build  excellent zoom lens  useful and easy to use features  and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks
__label__0 if you want a quality product  this ai nt it  the dreaded  remove the cassette  error is true and in full force  do nt take my word for it  search the net and find the hundreds  upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way  i highly suggest the panasonic agdvx it costs a bit more  but well worth it  before reading other reviews  make sure that they are comparing the gl to another cam  like tony l  shores  he compares the canon glpieceofjunk to the sony hdrfx sure  the sony is much better  but it is also a highdefinition cam  if you want hd  check out the panasonic aghvx do your research  read the reviews
__label__0 i read the book and saw the movie  which other than title and major characters  have little in common  i ca nt say i really liked either  the book is a little funnier  my major learning from the whole project was when  who wants to be a millionaire  taught me about  roman a clefs   of which  devil  is one  perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry  i d have been more fascinated by the inside look that  devil  provides  meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly  editorinchief of runway magazine  but somehow she s never quite devil enough  anne hathaway is passable in her second  or third   made over princess  role  the minor characters  including the wonderful tracie thoms as  best friend  lily  are mostly wasted

__label__1 some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt  lots of cool instrumentation  pete anderson did a great job with the production  this has nt left my cd player since i got it  days ago
__label__1 ray sawyer  rick cramer   agnes bruckner  eden   laura ramsey  rachel   jonathan jackson  eric   and dj cotrana  sean  star in this scary and bloody slasher movie  eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance  going steady one minute  broken up the next  eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress  one evening  ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food  known as the local nut case  ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town  later that same evening  ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge  swerving to miss eric s jeep  ray instead crashes into an oncoming car  the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge  the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge  ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car  after pulling her to safety  ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about  however  both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below  to make matters worse  the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes  who immediately begin striking at ray  all that can be heard are ray s screams as the car sinks  ray s body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue  but it does nt remain there for long  it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess  and the snakes were used to  cleanse  people by drawing the evil out of them  now  the evil venom is flowing through ray  now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray  possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him  begins to stalk unsuspecting victims  one by one  he exacts his revenge on eden s friends until only eden remains  who will win this final showdown  ray or eden  i ve always been a big fan of slashertype films  and characters like freddy from the  nightmare on elm street  series  as well as jason from  friday the th   ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly  the motives are the same  kill as many teenagers as possible  and ray succeeds in this very well  i thought the story involving voodoo was wellconceived  the special effects were good  too  i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans  although the movie is short  only about  minutes   there s lots of slashing in a short amount of time  if you enjoy a good slasher flick  then do nt miss  venom
__label__1 jeff beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time  what you get here is an abbreviated version of him live  his song selection is not the best  but freeway jam which is one of my all time favorite beck songs is included  you also ger scatterbrain and blue wind  she s a woman the old beatles song is also included  jeff beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off  the songs with the jan hammer group to me are very average and infact distract what beck is trying to to  unfortunately this is his only live album from his instrumental era  i truely wish he would release a dvd of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on dvd  the idea was good  the cd is too short and not up to snuff
__label__0 i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college  and because he spoke so highly of it  i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it  i definitely regret that decision  if you re thinking of buying it  rent it first  it was dull and obnoxious  not to mention weird  the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate  which is why i gave it  star instead of    however  if you re still interested  definitely rent it  you might enjoy it
__label__0 i m not a big fan of communism  nor of stalin  but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin  in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war  dont waste your money on a propaganda book  better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer  thats what biographies are supposed to be
__label__1 i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie  to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country  even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today  the message is still clear  those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie  this is certainly one of burt lancaster s better roles  and he plays it with much guesto  if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background  this movie has a strong message  do nt listen to the word of god from others  if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible  do so in your own way  do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money  even in this modern day and age  the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong  mr bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek reelection  everyone who is a born again christian  or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country  the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived  meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty  if there is one   still  a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today
__label__1 nice and compact  the tripod does nt really work as i expected  i am using my own tripod  overall is a nice little unit for the money
__label__0 these did nothing for me  ask your doctor about aphthasol  a prescription drug approved by the fda   which means it s passed rigorous government testing standards  aphthasol changed my life
__label__1 reminds me that conservation has been in the minds of some for a very long time  my grandson who is four loved the story and understood the concept
__label__1 i rarely write reviews  but i need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is  i have a fouryearold and an eighteenmonthold  and this cd is in heavy rotation at our house  my husband and i love the music at least as much as they do   it s stylish and sets a great mood as we re making dinner and doing dishes  the kids love it too  needless to say  my fouryearold s favorites are three blind mice  she loves when the farmer s wife squeaks that she ll give back the tails  and the final track by peggy lee  where she says the word poop  as in  party poop    endless laughter ensues   ella fitzgerald s atisket  atasket and chew  chew your bubblegum are priceless  all in all  i highly recommend this cd   everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
__label__0 i love to hear old standards and such  but i like to hear people who put their own take on it  i ca nt stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe  where are the male versions of nora jones  tone down the cheese  we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter  not hams like buble  dusk  or boring singers like diana krall  but what can i expect from the music industry  rarely do the best songstylists get lots of attention  so  hmmm  nevermind  i guess it s always been that way
__label__1 very convenient to use  however  since the neck band is rigid and does not fold  it is difficult to carry
__label__0 the songs are boring  the lyrics are plain  i am so dissapointed  i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song  how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me  andrea s solo album sucked  now this  i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again  i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album  instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc
__label__1 the earlier reviews pretty much said it all  this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the s  swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often  however  if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band  because they are nt so much shoegazer  in that coughsyrupdreamynoise way  as they are sonic rock  yes  rock  who knew it could still be done  and believe me  they do it well  and uniquely  if you ve listened to swervedriver before  then tehre is nt too much more to say  buy this album  it s not as hifi as th dream or mezcal head  in my opinion their best album and one of the best of s decade   but not as fast or dirty as raise  now  if you have never listened to swervedriver  this might not be the best album to start with  it all depends on your tastes  personally  i would suggest starting with th dream or mezcal head  either way  this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album  great lyrics  superb and unique songs  and that urge for more when it s over  sadly  this band was vastly illtreated by labels and they are no longer together  however  some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway   but if you want to see what you missed in the s  even more so  if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was  swervedriver is a must
__label__1 i recently purchased microsoft office  and so far  i have had the chance to use microsoft word  i am familiar with the product as i have had the older version before  with my old computer  i was pleased to find that i had no trouble with using my old files with this new software  i also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use  i was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning  i am also glad that it is nt very much different from the old version  so i was able to use the program easily  without much adjustment
__label__1 i have nt seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block  busters i had to rent it  my favorite part is when tom essex played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the head and the head said  get that damn screwdriver out of my head  i could nt stop laughing it was so funny  i never really liked many horrorcomedy movies but this one is really good  the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook  he was not only funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot  if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing  he makes me want to watch it over and over and over again
__label__1 the engine behind this program is from chief architect  who  from what i understand  are developers of professional cad software  it shows in this program  while this program has one of the best d walk around and capabilities  i tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses  and this one has some good usable tools  like most consumer level landscaping programs  this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home  unlike other programs  the bhg software allows you to import and mask your own plant images  this is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use  all the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there  for now  and with the choices i know of that are available to you  i find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there  this design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial cd  it was easy to install and start using right away  i think most folks would do quite well with this one
__label__1 flight from death is a  must see  documentary  i saw it three times since i ve received the dvd last week and each time i discover new aspects  images are beautiful and the commentary  narrated by gabriel byrne  is just outstanding  before seeing it  i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of ernest becker  as a reader of becker s books for many years i can tell that patrick sean and greg bennick had done a fantastic job  each important parts of becker s understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained  i understand now why this documentary won seven prizes  please do not hesitate to buy this dvd you wo nt regret it
__label__1 well presented  easy to follow along  and easy to revisit previous lessons  videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played  not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students  some of the accompanyment  singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along  some of the material  songs may not be to everyones liking  but again  these are okay for the beginner  the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes  i probably would nt recommend this to be the only source of learning guitarand i do nt think most people buying it would think it s all the will every need to become a great guitar player  i m sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique  i m trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful  bottom line  this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar
__label__1 the knots in my back  my  spots  never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer  one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was  he explained the concept  i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special  the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them  like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there  i bought one the next day  you do nt need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features  just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots
__label__1 what is the song that is being played when they are handoing out the dance benefit leaflets  email me at tarahillyardaolco
__label__0 i should have ordered thru amazon to avoid the confusion  since they state the vercsion needed  but where i ordered from did not mention the  version requirement  and on the box cover  there is no stipulation about this  only a generic statement that a previous version is required  how hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work       adobe customer service would not budge  so i am returning the product  of course  christmas is ruined for the person i bought this for  and i am out shipping and handling charges  thank you adobe  obviously  i ca nt recommend anyone buy from adobe at this point  it s easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish
__label__0 does not maintain water temp  splashes all over at the proper water level  rollers hurt  noisy  weak vibrations  i would nt want one for
__label__0 this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it  i assumed  since wahl has a longtime history of manufacturing grooming products  that this would be a quality item  was i ever wrong  this trimmer is constructed poorly and does nt cut hair  it will be heading to the trash
__label__1 fall through spring i always carry my r in coat pocket when i go out  this jacket fits my camera like a glove  allows access to all controls and lcd display through clear  heavy duty plastic film  once flap is opened  open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera  only time i zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery  otherwise  i just leave jacket on camera at all times
__label__1 if you re a fan of latin music and especially spanish guitar  you will love cafe tropical  every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar  to piano  violin  trumpet  and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments  every time i put this cd on i hear new things  which i find makes for an even more enjoyable listen  as usual  johannes linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre  and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself  highly recommended
__label__1 grew up on this group  love them then and love them now  own the  quot  best ofquot  collection but you can never compile the best on one cd  for those winans fans you know what i m talking about  these brothers are music genuises especially marvin winans  like stevie wonder they were ahead of their time  my favorite song on this album shares the message of all times   quot  together we standquot  opens up the eyes to all race  religion  and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background  entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as stevie wonder  teddy riley  and aaron hall  i like the flavor the cameos add to this album  if you re into midtempo music this is the album to purchase
__label__0 i purchased two aquis microfiber  waffle  white   x  inches  towels  although they are quite expensive  the positive reviews made them sound great  well  they are not  the towels are quite thin  and do not rub  slide well on the skin  they give the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when you rub your skin  they are the same thickness as a dish towel  so we are using them to blot the dishes when they come out of the dishwasher  save your money on this one
__label__0 main pro  an additional unbiased source of information in an area where there is not nearly enough main con  too few products reviewed as a first time mom  and a compulsive researcher  i found this book most helpful as a cross reference with other sources  baby bargains  girlfriend s guide to baby gear  and reviews in babycenter and at amazon   i will say though that i found myself trusting the advice of alan and denise fields and of vicki lovine more than that of the authors of this book  when reading through bb bargains and girlfriends guide i felt more keenly that the products were being judged by real parents who thought about parents  needs  consumer reports seemed a little less thoughtful and definately less comprehensive  getting ready for a baby is a behemoth task  the sheer amount of stuff you need  clothing  bedding  furniture  strollers  car seats  feeding devices  toys  and the myriad of choices that exist for each item can be very overwhelming  and because there are so many crib manufacturers  stroller makers  etc  no single superstore like bbrus or target can carry all of the  major  brands  it would be impossible to register at any one of these stores using only the recommendations of consumer reports  book  now perhaps not everyone enters parenthood quite as clueless as i was about baby gear  and if you have friends and family who can share enough information with you  and better yet stuff   about these products  then you probably do nt need any of these books  but if you are the kind of person who wants to know all of your options and who works to get the most for her or his money  you ll need more than this book
__label__0 i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii  we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated  i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what
__label__1 i searched and researched the lens to purchase with my canon rebel xti for weeks because i knew that i did not want the kit lens  i also did not have the money to spend on a     or  dollar lens  in the end after reading countless reviews  ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion  this lens looked to be the best value  for the money i really do nt think that you can beat this lens  it focuses quickly  it is really quiet while doing it  and it is sharp enough for the money  plus it has full time manual focus  which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range  the only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the  crop factor on the rebel xti  but i would much rather have to deal with that than a subpar image  in summary i would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who does nt have the money to buy an  l  series lens  it is really a great value
__label__1 this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well  the build is solid  metal construction   the glass is also descent quality  about the performance  it absorbs some uv light  the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable  probably the sky a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me  now  about the one problem which is the internal reflection  i ve heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting  i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light  night situation  the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong  bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure  the surrounding environment   to put it in example  which hopefully is easier to understand   when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection  as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides  corner of the picture  and not in the center of the picture   the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear  if you move the light far enough from the center   and if the light is nt too bright  contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection  but of course most of the time  a lamp at nightime is often very bright  but the point that i m trying to make is that the internal reflection does nt happen all the time during low light or night time  additionally  the internal reflection is nt only happening at night  it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example  basically same rule as above  on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area  and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side  dissapear  also depending the angle   but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations  hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation  which is not hard to do   i m actually not a fan of lens filter  any filter  as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object  but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens  and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do nt have any filter for your lens yet
__label__1 this movie is intimate and special  some reviews say it is the story of obsession  of fetishism  of trivial things  however  this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy s life  his fantasy woman  the character malena rarely speaks throughout the movie  but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her  through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young  love   this perspective makes her ideal and special  with few flaws  as a fantasy woman is to a young man  malena is instantly a likeable character  not awful and disgusting like those using her  we cannot forget that our narrator  renato  is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story  therefore  he is unreliable as a narrator  malena s sins are washed clean through his judgement  and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women  however  renato has had years to think about everything  to contemplate what really happened to her  so  in the end  the people who use her are completely despicable  unable to garner any liking  of course  she is a victim  but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men  the movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems  she is from another city and her husband  for most of the movie  is dead  yet  she chooses to not escape but to stay  and her fate is sealed  the music in the movie was nominated for best score in   and it is beautiful  emotional  it truly adds to the feeling of the movie  i would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story  emotion  and characters  you will never forget this movie

__label__0 gday  i bought dns  standard to use mainly on trips so i could keep a diary of the trips  when i tried it  the voice recognition was soso  the worst part was that after about  pages the  file  fills up and you have to begin a new one  now maybe there is a way around this  but i and no one else will be able to find out from nuance  their customer disservice is down at the bottom of the marianas trench  i could make reference to whale droppings  but that would nt be polite i emailed them about this and was told to call for an answer  however  that would be my one and only free call  i really think  nuance needs competition  hello there microsoft

__label__0 this album had two good songs at the most  ralph was good with new edition  it s apparently obvious that he ca nt stand alone  bobby should have been the lead for new edition  then we may never have seen this terrible album  ralph is nt that good of a singer  this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does nt mean you are the best  ralph is miles behind bobby

__label__0 we have used quickbooks on a pc since the s  we loved the way inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting  quickbooks for mac is terrible in comparison  if you plan to use the payroll features  it is unusable  quickbooks mac payroll redirects you to the internet  where it is handled by paycycle  an independent company   payroll is not integrated at all in the mac  instead import  export operation   on the pc  it is part of the quickbooks application  we could not get job costing to work  and the tax calculations made no sense  we were paying tons of money to paycycle  so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically  we finally reverted back to quickbooks for windows and are much happier with intuit handling our payroll
__label__1 i recently purchased this for use with my ex  if you use alot of flash for event photography  you will want this in your kit  it is expensive  but i think it is worth every penny  it will keep you from changing aas in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant  you can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure  you can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt  mounting on my d was just not comfortable  it gets in the way of the handgrip
__label__1 this product is a masterpiece  it s a testimony to early st century thinking about the world  the earth  learning  and software  it s a swissarmy knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work  check out the map tool  and the view of the earth at night  it s delight and a gift to an active mind  somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed  what they ve come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids  take math  the math tool alone is worth the price of admission  this is where algebra class should start  math lovers will eat it up  for the less than loving  student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts  it even links homework help for many of the major math books  you put in the textbook  the assignment  and it steps the student through the problems  homeschooling  read no further  just buy it  geography  the map tool  especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space  with or without political boundaries  and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures  literature  it s got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading  and not just the stuffy victorian novels  but ursula leguin and even some titles that i did nt think were worth reading  the language tools   you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages  plus dictionaries and translators  and even plugins for ms word that make it easy to write in french or spanish  no more funny key combos to get a cedilla  plus encarta encyclopedia   which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search  i m sure i m leaving something out  the only problem is  it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with ms office  that said  if you take education seriously  you ought to have this on your computer
__label__0 i tried  i really tried  but i was simply incapable of getting into this program  the lead character in nighty night is so thoroughly  contemptably selfcentered and unlikable she makes larry david in curb your enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear  this is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life  she s also insane  completely  and not in a cute or funny way  she dose nt live in this world  she lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her  making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous  dishonest or rude  she literaly has no idea she s a monster  i can see how that could be funny but not with this show s incredibly dry  lifeless presentation  i never thought i d say this but nighty night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we re supposed to laugh  and i hate laugh tracks
__label__1 rem has had a helluva lot of hits  and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands  this track album does a good job for its length  but i really do feel a cd hit package is warranted  the biggest omissions are  shiny happy people    it s the end of the world as we know it   and  this one goes out to the one i love   it would nt surprise me if the band did nt really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection  however  there are a few other more minor hits i know from them that are missing  like  radio free europe   i just ca nt think of other titles right now  but there are more than a few other omissions too  many of the minor hits that are included here  thankfully  are very good and will grow well on you   the great beyond    bad day    all the way to reno    ebow the letter   and  imitation of life  are songs i have nt heard enough of and i m glad they are on this collection  still  i hear rem is coming out with another compilation and i imagine it will be more complete  i suggest waiting for that album when it comes out

__label__1 when i was a kid  i religiously read many of the marvel comics  the avengers was one of my favorites  in my dreams i would have loved to have read all of the issues  but the expense would have been  way  too much  now  after so many years the opportunity is finally here  i was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore  but i took a chance and bought this dvd anyway  it was worth it  by a mile  i am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed  as much as i would have as a kid  it will take a long time to get through them all  but i ll enjoy every minute  stan lee  thank you for such a simple pleasure  great stuff for kids of all ages
__label__1 pro  great story  teriffic acting  beautiful setting con  some pacing flaws  but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her wellcast  perfunctory foil  as as the story unfolds  the differences between british and american style  and culture  are revealed  providing a nice subtext to the plot  one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears  from the central story to the character s lives  good actors all  but my  best actor  award goes to the photographs themselves  the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once  a visually rich film
__label__1 i am a big fan of   curling irons  but they can be difficult to find  my last one  different brand  wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now  i have shoulder length hair  fairly thick  plus wavy and frizzy    curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair  while also turning it under  or up  if desired  at the ends for a nice  finished look  i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat  straight iron while achieving superior results  you will not get  curl  with this curling iron  you will get smooth hair quickly and easily  highly recommended

__label__0 i discarded the dvd after watching it  if you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home do nt buy this version of the secret garden
__label__1 loved this  it is awesome because it is both land and sea camera  so you need just one  you can get tons of accessories and flashes for it  it is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections including making your photos more in focus in case you shot them blurry  i cannot wait to use it again  well underwater for diving i mean
__label__0 the author dwells too much on knife fighting rather than the knives  i found the book to be a disappointment
__label__0 this game can get very boring  it s very confusing and hard to control  it is sooooo frustrating          the instruction booklet does nt come in handy either  like some other people  i only got rabbits too  i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses  but  only rabbits came  buying this game was a big mistake  it is reallly no fun  do nt waste your money on this game  i gave up about a month ago  i ve left it on the shelf and have nt touched it since
__label__0 i bought this iron for my teen daughters  actually i bought it twice  since i did nt have much choice where i was shopping  both times it died  the first iron lasted about  months  and the second lasted  weeks  just dies  no warning  my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair  i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research
__label__1 i like this author s work so much that i actually bought the hard cover since i could nt wait for the pb to be issued  however  p  d  james  view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times  a contrast to her autobiography   in this one  there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living  never really feeling any joy or often even happiness  however  when adam and emma come together at the end  there was a ray of hope  please  ms james give us a new book asap
__label__0 i have been a user of paperport since version   skipped the upgrade to  because of bad reviews  received an upgrade notice in the mail  so i decided to buy it  it turns out it was a bad decision  the scanner that i use with  is the same as with  and is on nuance s hardware compatibility list  the problem is  it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with paperport  then  when i did get it installed  and i used the advanced setup option with it  tested it  all looked good  except everytime i scan something  the program crashes  it is literally unusable as a scanning solution  i have seen a few companies with products that were once really good  sell it off to another company  and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned  it seems that this may be the case  there are no updates or bug fixes for   and i will not buy another paperport version in the future  i will attempt to go back to   and probably stay with that  if i run into any issues with it over time  i will look elsewhere  and i recommend others do the same  i normally do nt write reviews for products  but this one is so poor  i just had to warn people
__label__1 this is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish  action packed  and very smart  great cast too
__label__1 quot  above suspicionquot  offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals  the dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man s  bakula s  past comes back to haunt him  consequently tearing his life and his family apart  his wife  sciorra  becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses   quot  above suspicionquot  has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller  as well as a heart warmer  it s a must see for almost any movie fan  just do nt confuse this  quot  above suspicionquot  with the film starring christopher reve
__label__0 i ca nt believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video  easy to master   i found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow  the camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork  i am an athletic twentythree year old girl who is not a slow learner  i just excercised with this dvd for the first time and it was really tough  i did nt get a work out at all because i was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much  she does nt break down the moves at all and it s just so much more confusing than it needs to be  the dances are cute  but it s frustrating that she does nt explain the moves  i hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing
__label__0 i will be honest i like dolph lundgrena look at his filmography you see bmovie classics such as  the punisher   universal soldier  and  blackjack  dolph has been going trough a slumpstorm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion  aka fallen knight  but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom  agent red first of all steals it s music from predator and it s plot from counter measures  oh i m not finished yet  it steals footage from storm catcher          the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgrennow penner is  dolph lundgren is  for goodness sake  yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a missionthis scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in thereit turns out more footage is stoleni swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle iii saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measureswhat the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk  i have no idea  when i was a teen  when showdown in little tokyo came out  i thought dolph lundgren could nt sink lower then showdown in little tokyo  then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph could nt do worsewell i pray he ca nt do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my lifethis is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson  bottomlineon agent red s cover it says  once exposed you cannot survive  take this as a warning
__label__0 gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie  of course  it was just a product of its time the mids it s not a film trying to recapture the erait is the era   still the storyline is slim and the going slow  interesting scenes appear here and there  the parts are definitely better than the whole  there s an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should  actually  thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was  it s subtle  i ll grant you that  and a nice character studyand yet   we were counting the minutes left in the film by the end   only  minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives    so that s not a good sign
__label__0 i have many pet peaves about this camera  a  the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark  do nt try to record indoors b  did nt fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button  not good c  did nt start up fast enough i always missed the shot d  the camera photos are nt of good quality e  microphone not that great you could nt even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera  f  if your laptop is over  years old  even if you ve got windows xp  do nt expect the software to be compatible  g  the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger  i d lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out  i felt like i had to just manually zoom  ie  walk up closer to the subject i honestly say stay away from the samsung s and the sony s are nt much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories  ie  only sony products are compatible with the camcorder  i finally bought a jvc and they are awesome  the take more light in  better acoustical recording  better zoom function  quicker start up  and lighter  you can even buy the cheapest model  which is pretty much what i ve got  and the picture is great  my parents commented on how they thought i must have a camera like the news reporters  as it s the same quality
__label__0 i purchase this instrument twice  the first time there were black specks in the lense  so it was returned  the second time was worst  ie same black specs but the thing did nt work at all  i have also checked this manufacturer s other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense  this is nt a quality optical product
__label__0 if you use microsoft office  word  excel  do nt buy it  links to your previous pdf simply do nt work  adobe knows about it  but have no viable work around  stick with prevous versions
__label__0 i bought this product after reading the other online reviews saying how easy it was to use  i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy  it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke  i would nt recommend this product to anyone unless you re a professional architect  computer genius
__label__0 i ve been a user of pinnacle version   which i loved   and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds  what a disappointment this  upgrade  has been  crash after crash  what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could  help  them develop a better product  this means to me that they knowingly released bad code  and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a  guess what  i do nt want to help pinnacle build a better product  i want a product that works when i purchase it  lesson learned  next time i read a bad review on a product  i m staying away
__label__0 i was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd  i would not recommend anyone buying this dvd until the quality is back to that of a professional recording
__label__1 we purchased this dvd because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it s a great supplement to reading books  he loves this dvd and we love the variety in it s approach  we did nt realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years
__label__0 i do nt know what to say about this book  it is the single worst book i have ever read in my young life  i feel like i ve witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it  i would say at some point in the book  maybe about halfway  every line of dialogue  every characterization  every plot point  is absolutely terrible  this book is truly an offense to literacy  and i cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash  i can only imagine that robin cook either allowed a child to write this book  or was chronically drunk while writing it  either that or he has lost his faculties altogether  i have read children s essays that have been better written  while it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book  the highlights are  knowing the mystery  pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery cliche mania with lines like   i going to get to the bottom of this mystery  and when the character s discover something  giving each other highfives  racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions  own guns  and play basketball  stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny  incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros  nyc coroners  fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body   also paying for their friends to come too  wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working  and asking questions  and getting answers to them real easy  incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes   ie making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them  the book spirals into total madness in the last  pages to a beyond implausible ending  i got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it  if anyone thinks this book is better than two stars  they need their head examined
__label__1 acronis true image  home is really great for making backups and moving entire partitions to a new disk  very easy  foolproof  and dependable  good product  good price
__label__1 my one complaint is that after i listen to this cd  the catchy tunes get stuck in my head  and then i want to keep listening to it more and more  i love the selections on this cd  the fact that the songs are in english  i always wondered what the  figaro  figaro  figaro  song was about    and that a little background is given to each piece as well
__label__1 this is the easiest way i ve ever been able to make cds  it realy makes photo cd s easy and produces a great product  a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd  the automatic slide show goes through the differ nt files as if they were just one file with no seperation  but the pictures are still separated in each person s file for ease when printing and so forth  it s great  wish i would have had this years ago
__label__1 these bars are absolutely fantastic  they are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein  g   they taste pretty good  far better than most bars  i prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor  out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream  next being the peanut butter  and then chocolate  a chocolate mint flavor has just been released but i have yet to try it  i recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out
__label__1 i teach second grade and my class just loved this book  chris van allsburg is one of our favorite authors but this is one of his best
__label__0 this dude is selling info that you can learn from anyone with very limited computer knowledge  all of the same info is on the net for free  this product exists for one purpose  to steal from you  this pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card  bucks a month without their permission  he could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product  but scams seem to be his thing  avoid   this is the worst company that i have ever delt with in my entire life  this john guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed  he is an embarrasement to his company and his family  at least a mugger steals from me face to face  this snake is sneaky about it
__label__0 this camera has a very poor lens  at x zoom  the barrel  spherical distortion is enormous  try taking a picture of a tiled wall  image quality is also soso when a picture is viewed at   scaled down on a computer monitor  the quality is ok  color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance
__label__1 i got this software from office max  which is on sale for  on last week  my  year old kid  start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time  pros  settings are awesome  you can choose two types of keyboards you can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects you can choose  different musics or do not have any  you can choose the difficulty levels  games and encouraging things for kids  cons  still needs to find one  how does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you  adult can also learn from this cd  just by skipping cartoon talk
__label__0 my son had an earlier version of math blaster  it was wonderful  i saw this new version and expected more of the same  wrong   after  minutes of loud sounds  and pulsing video  he was complaining  it was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff  never could get to a point where learning might take place  wish i could get my money back  after this disaster  we purchased mia s math adventure  this was more in tune with the first math blaster
__label__1 there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments  i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments  i am glad i did  the light from the mirror is bright  the slide bar for the different light settings works very well  if you hold the switch to the count of  or  and then release the lights work every time  i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use  the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out
__label__1 this camera is perfect for me i have a  an a  an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film  this camcorder is small enough that some days i have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go  also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed  the settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use  it takes really good video s an pictures although ive not taken alot of still pictures because i like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip  this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc  ive got a few  gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go  the battery does not last a long time so i recommend a couple extra  there pretty cheep here on amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your pc for any lengh of time  i dont know anything about camera s an how they work i just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera  camcorder ive seen
__label__1 wow  i must say that the new office  is way better than the  it did take some time to get the hang of it because microsoft changed around the icons and buttons  however  i do like it because now in word  excel  and powerpoint  you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide  in the end  i think the  is much more userfriendly than  i recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the new  microsoft office
__label__1 i purchased this firefly remote a month ago to work with my pcpvr  i have got a hauppauge pvr card and beyondtv    as my computer and tv set are in different rooms  i thought it would be convenient to have an rf remote control so that i can still control video recording  playback while sitting in front of my tv  rf signals can usually travel a longer distance  and most importantly  they can penetrate walls  however  my first installation with the firefly remote was not a totally success  it functioned well  but i have only measured a foot of workable distance  with full battery power  and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby  i thought either i had a defective item  or the product was not as good as they said  i contacted snapstream for support  and they suggested to try a different usb port or use a powered usb hub for plugging receiver  my computer has  usb ports   in back and  in front  all built on the motherboard  i was using a front usb for the measurement  after i switched to an usb port in back  everything becomes perfect  i have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard  usb ports can be different  which may provide different power levels for external devices  now my firefly works great for my application  which is about  feet of transmission distance and with a wall  and some blocking objects as well  inbetween  firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse  although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse  it comes in handy for quickandeasy controls  for the convenience the firefly remote brings  i give it  stars

__label__0 ageless body is deepak s attempt to neutralize the word  old  as in old age  the writer has a knack for making common words  like  body   mind  and  self   into profound concepts  his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies  but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound  if you like poetry  deepak may be your read   the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life   p     or try to interpret this one   the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe  in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born   p   at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible  he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over  intelligent design   he ca nt accept the growth of any cell  even a plant cell  without an intelligence involved  he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p    asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process  deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms  intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself  whether your word game tosses in the word  quantum  or not does nt change much  what a solipsistic thought  what a solipsistic world  i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of would nt  after awhile  go insane
__label__0 i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character  this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book  and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it  said parent would have no clue as it sure is nt mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book  i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading  but this time this particular book slipped under my radar  she told me that it had a reference to a gay character  which i took to mean just a passing reference  but when i read the book  it was treated more seriously than i thought  even going so far as to have the two girls kiss  it is inexcusable  both on ms pierce s part and on scholastics  no matter what the author s personal beliefs  it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents  i believe that as a parent  i m the one responsible for what my children see and do  but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision  anise hollingshea
__label__0 you can try this for free for up to  days by registering with microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy  when you re sure you want it  permanently activate it with the product key you get in your amazon package  the new version of excel has two huge advantages   it removes the old  column     row limitation  you can now have    columns and more than a million rows   excel  can use all the cores  processors in your computer  or you can restrict it to use only some  so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine   on my dual core computer  excel  is way faster than  at almost every task  i ve seen no crashes  hangs  or hiccups  but everything else about excel  is frustrating  the new  ribbon  interface is unnecessary and awkward   almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases  bypassing the ribbon with the new  quick access toolbar  is problematic because  bizarrely  microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons  leaving them with identical green circles  right now excel  costs more than excel  if the two plusses do nt help you  you may think that  is worth more
__label__0 a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their st one  that s not saying much because their st album was terrible  there was only one direction they could go   up  it s hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp  i said this about the young  fly   flashy album  and the same applies here  so i ll say it again  when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow  your album is in serious trouble  but let me balance that statement though  this is nt exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics  this is simple  bass heavy  crunk music  it s effective in it s purpose  but it s totally generic  the recipe for most party songs   and some of these songs are just flat out horrible   stop callin  me  is nt only horrible  but it is nt about anything if you re paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it  and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped   and who s idea was it to let dame dash  yeah  that dame dash  scream all over a song  bricks  the high   i want to know who the guy was that said  yeah  that s a good idea   dame is doing what he does best  so he s not at faulti blame the idiot that put him on the song   suckas come and try me  is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album  and if you ask me  the  white tee  remix was a step backward from the original  it would help if they could talk about something other than  haters   postin  up on the block  i swear they say that on the album at least  times   rims  jewelry  and weed  but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess  besides  if people buy this  why should they change  that s another story though  in short  the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack  the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible   i ll make you   step like ciara   come on  i could write that in my sleep  and it s hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar  once you understand the purpose of this album though  then you can find a few decent tracks  but do nt go getting your hopes up just yet  there are only  or  songs worth hearing   my music  is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b s good appearance  the best beats on the album are on  do nt play with me  feat  three six mafia and  freaky as she wanna be    do nt play with me  features production from dj paul  juicy j  so you know it s tight  i love three six  so that s my favorite song on the album  and  freaky as she wanna be  will be the second single off the album if they re smart  on top of our game is good for what it s supposed to be good for  partying andwell  that s it   but not much else  jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant  but i do nt know if this approach is gonna help him any  this album is better than their debut  but that s not really saying much  this should be pretty obvious  but i ll say it anyway  if you re into lyrics  then this is nt for you  if you want crunk beats to bounce to  then this is right up your alley  it depends on your preference  but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one  standout tracks  freaky as she wanna be  i think they like me  remix  feat  jd  da brat   bow wow  do nt play wit me feat  three six mafia  my favorite   and my music feat  bun b

__label__0 kate bush s second album   lionheart   may be the weakest in her catalog  its clear bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing  the kick inside part two   and instead reaches in a number of different directions  some successful  some less so  musically  the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record   in search of peter pan    in the warm room    a more pop structure   wow    rhythmic shifts   do nt put your foot on the heartbrake   an almost shuffle   fullhouse   and a gret rock song   hammer horror    lyrically  bush has added a level of sensuality to her work   symphony in blue   and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects   kashka from baghdad    the problem is that it does nt hang together well to my mind  admittedly  my rating for the album is in many ways relative to bush s other work  no album with the absolutelyu amazing  kashka from baghdad  can be all that bad  and certainly  symphony in blue  is strong enough to stop you in your tracks  but the album just does nt work for me  for early bush  try her debut   the kick inside   or the stunning  never for ever
__label__1 this was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they did nt have it at the best buy i went to  i like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip  most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot  all like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein  afterhours  foot prints  i left my wallet in el segundo  bonita applebum  can i kick it  rhythm  go ahead in the rain  and description of a fool  man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable  i wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd  the only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs  this is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics

__label__1 i just finished watching callie and son  i got my copy from the dollar store and it has another movie  power passion and murder  with michelle pfeiffer in it as well  it really was nt that bad  considering the price i paid  lindsay wagner is actually the main character and i think she did a great job  as did most of the actors in this film  the only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to  with a bit of editing and a bit better script  it would have been a great movie  the end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying  i d recommend it for someone to watch once  but i would nt pay more than i did for it  the dvd quality is really poor  the sound fades in and out  but for what it was  a bargain bin cheapy  i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it
__label__0 this is a great programme with windows xp but be aware that it conflicts with vista  the latest version of windows  an upgrade is recommended by nuance  the manufacturer to omnipage at double the cost of textbridge
__label__0 my mother bought this for me for christmas  she used the  available new and used  section to get it a little cheaper  she ended up paying  or so  when i put this on my wish list i thought that this hardcover version would be the arabicenglish  englisharabic  considering that it was  and the paperback of the arabicenglish only was available for  as it turns out  this is only the hardcover of the arabicenglish only  so for one  my mother paid an additional  for only the hardcover version of a book that i could have gotten in the paperback for  i still do not have the englisharabic of the hans wehr edition
__label__1 i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies  though i think  quot  the lost worldquot  is a bit weak  while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies  monster movies  or horror movies should own all three  i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies  but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies  i give this collection four stars only because the larger  more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two  you will definitely like the third movie
__label__0 our first unit lasted about almost  months  despite the relatively short lifespan  i thought the product was worth it considering the dirtcheap price  however  the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use  so  it went back to amazon the very same day it arrived our home  this product is so dangerous  without exercising some safety precaution  it can cause electrocution
__label__0 i originally read the novel  of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware  and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled  memory and mourning in postwar germany   i d just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel  it seems that the director wanted to make a more  hollywood  version of the film  and i think he succeeded  for instance  the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel  and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story  in general  the film has little to do with any of the original versions  and is far inferior
__label__1 the recipes in this book are often somewhat complex  but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful  braising does not aways take a long time either  one of my favorites is soybraised chicken thighs with star anise and orange peel   minutes total
__label__0 this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont  i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it  unfortunately  i was wrong  the main problem of the film was characterization  there were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character s actions  one minute  the small town girl played by heather graham is working at a nursing home  then she s downing alcohol  then she s jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason  in fact  she does nt even seem drunk   and all this entices the character colin firth to jump into bed with her  i think the heather graham character is supposed to be quirky  but because of the script and the way the film is cut  she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable  then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance  and this is no rebound relationship   basically  the movie continues along this vein  with minnie driver showing up as the darkhaired british exfiance who you ca nt see ever having had a relationship with colin  both actors are better in the much superior movie circle of friends   in any case  there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups  get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends  additionally  the setting is completely misused  beginning with the sign that says more than    people live in hope  in new england  that does not classify as a small town  they could have used the autumn setting and americanness of the people as restorative to the colin character  the suggestion of that is there  but it is never demonstrated  instead  they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the heather graham character downs a bottle of booze  and colin firth s character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town s people  although the hotel owners are fun  if unrealistic  the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character  finally  i do nt neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie  with the wierd cutting  it may have seemed like a good idea at the time  i think colin firth does his best at being an ambigious  but still likeable guy  heather graham  aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all  has absolutely nothing to work with  so you ca nt even blame her for the horrendous character she has  and everyone else  including minnie driver  is a complete caricature  although minnie driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film  i feel bad to judge this movie so harshly  but it is unneccessarily bad  and i had been hoping for something at least fun  these actors all have much better movies out there
__label__1 the dead were primarily a live road band  but on this and the other great album from   american beauty  the band proved their mettle in the studio  moving into less spacey territory  the music reflects their range  from country and bluegrass to folk  blues and rock  superb  ps  their early studio effortsanthem   aoxomoxoa  were also noteworthy experiments  but the music was nt as powerful as the live interpretations
__label__1 this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike  it no longer supports windows   which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use  it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years  the street maps it produces are accurate  except for a few minor glitches
__label__1 i enjoyed francis veber s  the closet   released in france in   for two reasons  first  it features an allstar ensemble of french acting  certainly a tribute to veber s skill as a director  just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits  daniel auteuil  françois pignon gérard depardieu  félix santini thierry lhermitte  guillaume michèle laroque  mlle bertrand michel aumont  belone  the neighbour jean rochefort  kopel  the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth  each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back  the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber s reputation  his previous release   s  the dinner game   was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece  actors get attracted to that type of skill  the second reason i got a kick out of watching  the closet  i just learned that  bend it like beckham  writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk remake for the screen for a targeted  release  with chadha at the helm  her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham s runaway success  so i feel like i m in on a really great secret knowing she s working on a remake
__label__1 let s face it  tinseltown has run out of original story lines  that s usually when they turn to remakes  i ve seen several remakes over the years  both tv and movie  but this is one of the best remakes i ve seen in quite some time  i really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line  what a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the tv show and pulled all of it s story from the comic book  if you were never into comics to begin with then you ca nt appreciate the story line  another thing that i feel is under appreciated about this movie is the cgi  people have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time  the amount of man hours that went in to creating the cgi is something to be applauded and appreciated  not mocked and thrown out with the trash  you have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value  most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it  the story of the hulk is a sad  depressing  dramatic story  there is nt anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something  the hulk was nt meant to be campy  it was meant to be serious  my only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play banner s love interest  the little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted
__label__0 hey  never liked ja fool  he is and will always be over  where is he        like i care  any way      has sold  million cd s and ja fool had the nerve to say  do nt sell   ha       ja fool    greatest hits           nuff said  over ja fool rule

__label__0 i will not try to say that i asserted the painstaking  analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of heidegger  more than that  i have no interest in doing so  it is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being  existence   and my reading did nt lead me to any other conclusions  so as i said i have no interest in reading this a second time  further  deeper  or slower  being and time is chock full of invented terminology  to the extent that michael inwood was able to profit from his publication of a heidegger dictionary  whatever you might think the word  world  means  for instance  is not what heidegger means  and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing  pages or so  this is the case with his entire vocabulary  if there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by heidegger  i would not bring this up as a crticism  beyond the unventilated  severely sober  and utterly uninspiring character of being in time  i also call attention to the futility of it s project  if heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being  perhaps more than  years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him  that there is no question of being  why is  the question of being  so problematic  because it is unanswerable  maybe  or if it is answerable  we re not in any position to answer it   being  implies some kind of unvarying stability that just does nt make sense  and if you posit an idea that is so concrete  so constant  you ca nt just bend it to make it fit reality  you ve already betrayed your questioning  truth  including the truth of being  is a local phenomenon  truth is not always and forever true  it s true when it s true  but heidegger wanted an everlasting truth  a dogmatic anthropology  worse than the general uselessness of his project  and the toxic dregs left in his wake  heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thoughtprovoking way
__label__1 i first saw this movie on tv as a college student  i loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on vhs tape  i have watched this movie so many times i m surprised the vhs tape is still working  the actors are perfectly cast in the leads  they are so believeable in their portrayals that i could have gone to high school with them  the kissing scene is hot  clothes do nt need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene  the characters are not glossy  and that is what i love about john hughes  he portrays comingofage in all its naked and truest glory  not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years  if you re looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack  this is your type of movie
__label__0 this  offering stars giancarlo giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poisondipped needle before eviscerating them  the production is above average slick and the performances are fine  especially from giannini  but i just did nt find it involving  suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward  it s not bad  just average  the climax and the killer s unmasking is particularly weak and anticlimactic  fans of the genre seem to really like this one  but i suggest a rental before a purchase
__label__0 reference picture quality on hddvd  basically unwatchable though  i would not recommend the blind buy on this one
__label__1 over all i am very happy with the product  it has paid for itself in this short time by just making happy birthday cards  i am not totally happy with the product and i am not sure if i would buy it again  the product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which i am not happy about   even though the product gives you cd s which contain art and project models their is more art and projects on the internet  to access these art and projects you need to go on the internet which is not a problem  what is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site  if you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project  you will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site  this is frustrating and annoying  it makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand   the other thing i was not happy about was  i was given a coupon  in the box  for a  year membership to the  million image club  to get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the internet  after it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word  over the internet  that allows you to go on the site  well  i filled out all the paperwork  sent it in over the internet  as required  but was not sent a password  well  i tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem  it seems that broderbund does not control the product but  encore  does  you will receive almost no help at all from  encore   the only place to get help is from a forum which could nt give a reasonable answer on what i should do  so  i am now not getting access to the  million image club   to tell you the truth  i do nt really care  when you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from  you really do nt need a million more
__label__0 darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games  to make a commercialquality game in this language would be lunacy  basic just is nt quite flexible enough to do that with ease  and the darkbasic renderer looks very  very ugly  however  basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with  if you re trying to get into serious game development  learn c and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx  or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source  and make sure you ve learned a good deal of physics and math
__label__1 i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school  i used it because its what is being used at my office  i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note  which i really have nt been able to find a use for   otherwise  it works the same as other ms office packages i ve used in the past
__label__1 this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series
__label__1 dvd  presents a terrific hourlong history of the franchise  it hits both the high  and lowpoints  and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history  lambeau  hutson  lombardi  starr  nitschke  the ice bowl  favre  white  the nine nfl championships  the three super bowls they won  i  ii  and xxxi   and the one they lost  xxxii   the best fans in the league  the smallest venue  the most legendary stadium  and the team s miraculous survival over  years  in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans  the highpoint  of course  is the minute section entitled  lombardi  which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl s greatest coach but at the end of this dvd about the packers  heroic ongoing history  you realize that as great as lombardi was  the team is greater still  dvd  was produced earlier in vhs format  i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb  and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history  other reviewers have justly praised its playbyplay reconstruction and modernday interviews with the participants  yes  kramer was offside but luck is a part of any game  and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter  like another reviewer  i love the postgame interviews  even the glimpses of green bay in  the muted colors of the frigid game  maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the s i see the same thing in footage of other games  and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed
__label__1 i wish the reviewer had stated whether ms office  small business edition satisfies the requirement  pending clarification  i ll stick with encarta  despite its less  than  version  user friendly search page  encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and i m more than willing to predict that  is worthy of  stars
__label__0 image quality is pathetic  it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso     rest assured  you will be disappointed  i returned mine within a day
__label__0 someone suggested i listen to this because i was  at the time  into what lame beretwearing recordstore dips would call  creatively aggresive  music  then it was death metal  which i prefer without cursing or filth  you understand   since then i ve found the ascension into gabber and then fullon unmitigated hardcore  anyway  mr bungle  tepid  uninteresting  bland  stupid  gives the chinstrokers something to fascinate over  let them  someone s got the fuel the economy
__label__1 i do nt like this album as much as their earlier stuff  i have liked each release less than the previous  and this one falls right in line with that trend  the opener  quot  quality revenge    quot  is one of their best songs hands down  though  this is a very good cd  but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music
__label__0 i recently bought  items from this brand  lumiscope  actually this is the only item that works among them  though i am kind of suspicious about it s inconsistent readings from time to time  i think braun irt is a much better product  which i bought one for my parents in china  during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings
__label__0 i have tried everything  firewire  usb  there was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your pc then to your camera  then turn on the pc then turn on the camerathen wait for the stars to align in the right order  if you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged  what kind of a crazy world does panasonic live in  well  i followed the instructions to the tee  downloded the right drivers and all and yet my pc does not recognize the gs or the gs i have used both  the gs is a new purchase so this is definitely going back  i thought  this model would have gone away with the kinks but  no  so  my panasonic recorded dvs are gonna remain on the tape  i will never be able to put them on dvds  what a joke  this camera turned out to be

__label__0 i ve owned this cd  but did nt keep it for very long because it s too poppy and slick for my tastes  i guess when about  came around billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his  s style  and on this offering  he kind of wanted a  s or  s kind of sound  this stuff is just to slick for this hombre  he never made a solid album  after the release of glass houses  in about  this is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about  but if you ve got some integrity  you ll probably want to steer clear of this one  and buy anything he recorded in the  s
__label__1 i have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost  years now  last year i had over  seedlings on multilevel shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room   boy do i need a greenhouse   so this book was not a lot of new information to me  a lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet  but it s not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before i buy it   this is important  because i m not interested in refrigerating my seeds  weeks before i plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds   one major thing missing from this book was photography  there were drawings  but i m sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool  on the good side  this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment  and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant  annual  perennial  etc   its hardiness zone  and its flowering season  this allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone  the regular index was nt very useful  but one wonderful addition was an index of the common  amp  latin names  i refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography i was missing   almost makes up for italmost   of course  there is the standard hardiness zone map  but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates   nice   also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses  all in all  this book does a good job of covering the seed part  but a poor job of covering the bloom part
__label__1 this book is lovely  the perfect  medicine  for our hectic lives in this constantlychanging world  it has a lot of information packed in  yet is presented in a clear  straightforward manner  as i read the book  many things about my life and the way i react to change fell into place for me  and this book gave me not only new insights about myself  but also practical  positive ideas for better ways i can deal with change in my own life
__label__0 an absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians  i gotta say  i could have used a little more cowbell
__label__0 this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever  first  it does nt work  second  i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why  they wo nt give support until you register  the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software  and it takes you to a website that either does nt exist  or is always down  thus  it turns out to be a complete waste of money  not to mention several hours of time  run  do nt walk away from this software and this company
__label__1 the sundays come out with a cd once a decade  thus putting me in constant cravings for new material  though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band  they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch  truly vast and intimate at the same time  and a voice that speaks to something very deep  sad and lovely inside you
__label__0 this shampoo made my dandruff even worse  after using it  it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed  but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell s tea tree shampoo or something
__label__1 all there products are great  they smell good and are good  lathering is a more work but thats because they re natural  i use them on my babies and toddlers
__label__1 that about says it all  bill bryson is a hilarious writer  i like reading grammar books anyway  but i was always excited to read this book  as it s so entertaining  besides that  it can teach  or remind  you of a lot of good rules of writing  the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary  and some necessary entries are left out
__label__0 don  t waste your time and money on this compilation  what a cheap shot to take the consumers money  read the very fine print  it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it  shame on the distributor
__label__1 i give this book a  star rating  not because i believe in  the necronomicon   but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the s  the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome  though i doubt it s  authenticity  per se   it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other  and more valid than some   dead names  has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique  wandering bishop  phenomena and the socalled slavonic orthodox church  overall  both an informative and entertaining volume  whether you  believe  or not
__label__0 ordered one new from bh  in the x mode the top light came on  no worries  turned on the bottom setting of the switch  x  nothing  neither light came on  pitiful  sending it back
__label__0 whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people  but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around  few of them seem to have jobs  and party all day  the main character  sid  is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college  ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism   the film appeals to naive youth
__label__1 i ll have to accept that even tough i m not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release  the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there  for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album  it s very melodic and more mature  also the acoustic version of  the diary of jane  is amazing  i personally recommend the songs  breath    evil angel  and my favorite  dance with the devil
__label__1 i had my original clic readers for about six years before i had to replace them  i love the quality of the lenses  the ease of use and the fact that i do not have to remember where i put them when i took them off  i never take them off and have even ordered several pair for other people at work  i am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while  find them to be one of the most useful tools i own
__label__0 is larry an actual redneck  or is it all really a joke inside  larry s  mind  i sometimes think that dan whitney  larry s real name  knows what he s doing  i think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him  he is openly mocking them  and when they might get a tad uncomfortable  but then he ll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine  and they love him again  dan  larry started out as a  normal  comedian  there s footage of him on youtube before his larry incarnation   and was nt really getting anywhere with that  so he became a redneck  and is a multimillionare now  but all his redneck fans think of larry as a  regular guy   despite the fact that larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only nycers live in  for the record  nycers do nt all live in fancy houses  there s a lot of working class people in nyc who live in regular houses and regular apartments   so larry is taking advantage of illiterate  easily amused rednecks  just put on a flannel shirt  fart  wear a confederate flag  and say you hate liberals  then fleece the rednecks  i do nt think larry really has a redneck mentality  even though he s originally from nebraska  so he has some hillbilly cred  so to speak   i think he s just making a ton of money off of easily amused people
__label__0 as a gene autry fan  particularly of his christmas recordings  i was really looking forward to this release  butwhat a disappointment  i will look over the dropouts  obviously the source tapes have deteriorated  but what happened to the final three cuts  they are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable  and  i know the disc is short  but were the  second pauses between tracks really necessary  talk about choppy  no flow at all  this cd did make me do one thinggo back into my archives and pull out my original grand prix vinyl  i think i ll be doing a transfer and retire this cd to the bottom shelf
__label__0 i bought this from qvc  it will do the trick for quick touchups  not close hair removal  but close enough  unfortunately  mine is barley operating anymore  even with a fresh battery  i m not sure why the motor seems to be dying  maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long  as a result  i think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well
__label__1 this is a great book  i could nt wait to see what was going to happen next and how all the mixups would be straightened out  it is a very funny and delightful book  i hope there will be a sequel  we need to know what happens to these people  i feel like i know them
__label__0 pretentious and boring  too clever for its own good  the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ  and there s not enough of that  and this was the michael glenny translation
__label__1 this is a great book for a piano student  it allows them to enjoy true music while learning how to play fairly easy pieces  these are nt little dittys made up to teach notes  it is classical music  beautiful dreamer by stephen foster  traumerei by robert schumann and the happy farmer by robert schumann are my favorite pieces  they are a joy to learn and play  this music makes you want to practice  i also recommend my first book of christmas carols as well
__label__0 purchased this item in dec   screen burned out mar   on top of that screen quality was not that great  do not order order this item
__label__1 my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker  it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would nt want this new  much more attractive kind  it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things  when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car  and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large  we put it together in about  minutes and the price was great  what more can you ask
__label__1 i bought this a year ago and have taken many great pictures with it  it s light  has many features and can be used as an automatic when all you want to do is point and click  i ca nt recommend it enough
__label__0 the battery which  popped up  with my camera order does not match the camera  thus i am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery  i was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so i had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived
__label__1 i have been using the fuji e for almnost two years  with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers  here are the negatives    the flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky  if you do nt depress the shooting button all the way  it may not flash    in bright light  the screen on the back is unusable  it washes out the image  but the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue  the positives    it takes great pictures  really excellent    it s small  and easy to carry    the controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body  very easy to use    it has several automatic modes  sports  landscapes  portrait  etc  or you can use it on manual  i always use one of the programmed modes    the video option is not bad at all  my twelve year old  now   uses it  i was so pleased with this camera i bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago  and she is very happy with it  at it s current price i think this camera is a bargain  only reason i did nt give it five stars is because of the weak flash
__label__0 this pad works  basically  but it does turn itself after  minutes  there s no way to prevent that  this may be fine for some uses  but it s very inconvenient for others
__label__0 fight club is without a doubt the greatest film i ve ever seen  yeah  i m a fanboy  and what  and to make a great film flow  you need great music  right  well  you need great music that fits the film  and the dust brother s score more than does the trick  the film is dark yet satirical  and it needed a score that would compliment that  however  the score simply does nt stand up on its own  at times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere  but its only a part of a tense scene  and hence  it sounds rather empty by itself  no matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it  as i did   i would nt recommend it  like so many other scores  it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film
__label__0 the  drummer   more like  the antidrummer   on this is johnny cresci  he is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability  and literally has no idea what a    blues meter is  how he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time  for me  mr  clueless  cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his antirhythmic upchuckingkinda like driving an aston martin with a flat tire  i have tried to get beyond cresci s chops for over a year of listening now  and i simply ca nt do it  if you re a musician  his playing will make you extremely agitated  i m gonna have to trade this in  and go on listening to live adventures like i have for the past  years  this would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the    numbers  granted  this is an historically significant release  but i think it should have stayed in the vault  or released with johnny cresci having been digitally removed or replaced
__label__0 i m an avid tony yayo fan  but this album just did nt cut it  maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure  i do nt know  but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them  hopefully his next album will be way better  a few songs are good to listen to  i would think  coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about  but  so seductive  being your first single   come on  i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean  rating c
__label__0 as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction  however midway it turns into a romance novel  i give it  stars for holding my attention  a good beach read that can get you thinking  a little  about a time past  the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it    stars
__label__1 i ve found the recipes here generally simple and easy to make ahead  mrs burros is very clear in her instructions  although i had some problems with a chocolate roll  and the taste combinations are very good  as this book is an update of her original there are a number of amusing asides on changes in food ingredients and cooking styles between the two editions  not quite a  quot  musthavequot  but useful
__label__1 this live dvd was released as a companion to randy travis   worship  faith  cd  the concert was recorded on july    at calvary assmebly god church in orlando  florida  here  travis delivers many of the songs from the wf album  plus  pray for the fish  and his country radio hit  three wooden crosses   comments from travis and from several fans are added in between songs  like its audio companion  this dvd contains a great mix of classic hymns  camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs  some of the highlights include  you are worthy of my praise    just a closer walk with thee    we fall down  and  open the eyes of my heart   other noteworthy tracks include  shall we gather at the river    peace in the valley    above all  and  love lifted me   travis closes the show with  three wooden crosses   the first song recorded on a christian music label to ever top the country music charts   worship  faith  is a great dvd for lovers of worship music  lovers of country music  as well as for any and every randy travis fan  this is an excellent dvd
__label__0 i lovelovelove dark chocolate   and other strong  pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer  but these taste just plain wierd  it s not terrible  but i can taste the hoodia  sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate  i think they work at reducing hunger  but they give me gas so bad i ca nt be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia  or the gas  maybe i ll try the regular chocoleans  but i wo nt be buying this again  fyi  i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix  i have no problems with that  tastes great  works great  and no gas
__label__0 i had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer  the combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining  many people love this video but i just had a bad experience with it
__label__0 this device worked about  of the time on myself and only about  of the time on my father  unfortunately  it was a christmas gift for him and not for me  we ended up getting a self inflating one at circuit city that seems to be working just fine  it is possible that the problem lies with him  possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at cc worked just fine
__label__0 this movie was awfull  supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better  so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
__label__0 however  after using for  minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on  straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from amazon  it is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay  so if you have had good luck with one so far  be glad because i paid for the  day shipping could nt wait  and have great disappointment because now i have to return it
__label__1 i liked this lens  i used it  for the first time  while traveling through peru  it was lightweight and easy to use  at mm  most of my pictures turned out great  especially when i was on steady ground  taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge    i ve printed some x s of closeups i took using this lens and i was quite impressed with the quality  it was also in my price range  overall  i d say it was a  good bang for the buck
__label__0 we returned this video camera due to video picture quality  the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video  even after changing settings  the video had a  grainy  look  we just needed something basic to replace our  year old video camera and thought this would work  but the picture was worse than our previous camera  purchased the pvgs  next model up with ccd s and love this model  as a matter a fact we still had the gs  used the same tape  shot the same footage  and reviewing the two different shots  the gs did  better  the camera has a great feel in your hand  although the menu button can be difficult to press
__label__0 i love me some mamet  his dialogue takes some getting used to  since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm  i also love his dedication to his actors  employing the same ones over and over  so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe  which may very well be his point  however  edmond is the first mamet film to leave me disappointed and  worse  annoyed  macy plays edmond with typical wideeyed aplomb  edmond is a man who is weak  but is valiantly  if not clumsily  trying to be strong  the movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film  edmond then goes home  breaks up with his wife  and goes on a deaf  dumb  and blind search for himself  finding instead overpriced whores  pimps who are notwhattheyseem  and   generally   everything but himself  i get the point  edmond is the epitome of modern man s emasculation  unable to find his own balls with both hands  and his tawdry and panicked search through new york for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go  man or woman  to find  if not redemption  then the places where one  belongs   there are a lot of problems here  most superficially  there s one of packaging  the dvd box prominently features a picture of a gun  and no gun appears in the film  the tags on the box call the film  alternately  a mystery and a fastpaced thriller  when it is neither one of those things  not even close  this movie is  like most of mamet s work  based on a play  never before has it been more obvious  unless you count the absolutely brilliant oleanna   edmond is  essentially  a oneman show  with macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues  stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters  some of them played well   denise richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker   and some of them not so well   julia stiles seems overmedicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress   in spite of how they do and do nt help edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself  most of these characters seem disposable  making the movie come across as equally dismissable   i would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about rebecca pidgeon  mamet s wife  an actress who appears  i think  in every single one of her husband s films  this woman is  viewed in even the nicest of lights  one of the worst actresses i ve ever seen  and she sucks the life out of every scene she s in  in this movie she plays edmond s wife  and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence  it s nice that mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does  but one has to wonder if she d ever get any acting work at all if she were nt married to such a famous writer  director   at the risk of spoiling the film  i will say that  at the end  edmond finally does find where he  belongs   a place that  given his previous struggles  makes a lot of sense  although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers   but this is small consolation since  by this time  few people are likely to have any sympathy for edmond or where he ends up  his character s slapdash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate  fear  destiny and  ironically  meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience  a few good performances and some nice  visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along  avoid this flick  try oleanna or glen gary glenross instead
__label__1 shel natowsky  phd  this movie is costner s best  without any hesitation  the performances by hackman and sean young are also flawless  supporting roles are well honed  as well  the movie has everything you could want in a filmi mean everything  the screenplay is wonderfully written  acted  directed  and presented  why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore  everytime i run it  it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me  if you want to see a cold war drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever s pace  then see this one  satisfaction guaranteed  well done people
__label__1 metheny s an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles  moods  textures  and sounds  here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective  wideopenspaces musical journey across america  weaving in jazz  folk  country  rock  mountain music  and everything in between  if you love his work on joni mitchell s amelia  performed live on shadows and light   you ll love the sound of this record  the mood is mellow but not dull  quiet but not silent  and the results are spectacular  this is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier  or a short hop to burger king  works either way
__label__0 this version  bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story  but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story  the book was a simple good story  why did they abandon it and the characters so completely  the sets and costumes are great  but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period  i have only watched the first disc  but it be a while before i will be able to force myself to watch the others
__label__0 i ususally like aguilera and i need a song to practice for dance so i bought this one for  no other man  figuring i would like the other songs as well  i was so wrong  i hate the rest of them
__label__1 i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box  the best part  naturally  is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages  i feel refreshed everytime i used it  it took awhile to get the drainage to stop  but i am glad i purchased this system  it works
__label__0 save your money    i used the evaluation version of system mechanic version  for  days and thought it was great enough that i paid for and upgraded to system mechanic professional version on the subscription option for  i download the installer and ran it at  am on sunday morning  none of the modules  i repeat none worked  i uninstalled  cleaned out my registery and directories of all traces of this and the previous version and reinstalled  several time to the point that i gave up at pm the sam night  i search the online support and found no help  i wrote an email and as of today  wednesday  have not yet received a reply  their phone is constantly busy but i did get through last night at pm eastern time  they close at pm eastern  pm pacific  and was transferred to tech support  for the next hour i listened to the message   all of our support specialist are busy  please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received  until pm when the recording switched over to   thank you for calling iolo  our business hours are from am to pm pacific time  please call back during these hours   i m extremely upset  i m not a noob and have been using computers since the  days  as soon as my american express bill cycles  i will call and have the charge removed  version  was great  version  tanks  save your money  spend it with a company who responds to their customers
__label__0 being familiar with some adobe products  we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work  boy  were we disappointed  simply put  this tool is not so much a tool  but a hindrance  utilities such as transparencies  are not only difficult to make work properly  but hidden in nonintuititve locations  dialogs are nonstandard  which requires getting used to strange layouts in design  while seeminly small for just a couple items i ve mentioned  multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is  as has been mentioned by plenty of other people  it is also slow  if you want a simple image viewer  find anything else  even freeware  as i have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load  regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time  while i could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product  i will simple reiterate what others had also said  it is cumbersome to use  slow to use and load  unintuitive with poor layout and design  and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility
__label__1 you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slutbut it s actually the opposite  i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school  this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like  but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two peoplethis movie is the real thing  i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
__label__0 i have read baldacci s first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them  this one  however  is just awful  not only the character s dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie  the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this  there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows  with lame lines like  the gun was loaded  and so was i   that is exactly what this book is like  except it goes on for  pages  there is nt a single interesting character in this book  in my opinion  you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end  it s the bataan death march of novels  i hope this is an aberration  i ll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good  but one more stinker like this one and i ll drop his name from my reading list
__label__0 i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews  i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual  the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use  i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse  i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal  do not buy this product
__label__1 i bought from the  types of olay total effect  and i did try them after reading the instruction  there is no magical effect apeard after  month but there is diffrence  the company was very good in logistic maters

__label__1 growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart  i did nt think i d like this cd  one evening i was having dinner at a friend s home and they had this one playing  it was beautiful  being a little older now  in my early  s   i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now  this cd of rod s was nostalgic  romantic and extremely easy to listen to

__label__0 i love britney so i went against the bad reviews  man was i wrong it is sooooo bad   its the worst dvd in history
__label__0 well it was an obvious path to musical collapse  she should have stopped at tidal  if i d been dating her for the talent she showed on her first cd i would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis  the course of the last three cd s drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit  the lyrics on extraordinary machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies  the number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive  her original cd with it s collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing  blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke  what on earth gave her the impetus to try to go  artsy  by experimenting with music predating the second world war i ll never know  it s obvious her angst is no longer producing art  rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph  eat it up people  it s all about not having to think  it s the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block  judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture
__label__1 the petrified forest  is a filmed version of the  broadway smash  the play starred leslie howard and humphrey bogart and their stage performances were preserved when warner brothers bought the play to the screen in late  the addition of bette davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with howard after their earlier matching in  of human bondage   the film is set in the arizona desert  a killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there  the play has a few things to say about  the meaning of life  with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual alan squier played by leslie howard and vicious gangster duke mantee played by humphrey bogart  the morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of leslie howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance  the film was a breakthrough for bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking  davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career  she is also very well photographed by sol polito and her big eyes glow  the dvd print is excellent and a lot of extras are included  including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film  a terrible vitaphone short with the absurd toby wing and a funny cartoon about the cocoanut grove  the radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor tyrone power in howard s role  the dvd is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the warners gangster collection
__label__0 read some reviews that say  my cousin lost  pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day   and ask yourself  would nt that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day   this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value  if you wo nt drink water and exercise unless you have  special  water imbued with mythical powers  than by all means  this is the product for you  but if you prefer to save your money  simply exercise  eat healthier  and drink regular tap water
__label__0 they have made several changes  some good  most bad  since i bought my last sony handicam in    first of all  there is no carrying strap  this is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera  i managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain  the docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer  you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes  this messes up my editing program  fortunately i still have my old camera  the ability to take still shots is better  more megapixels  but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge  while i was told most people prefer to use the led screen  i do nt knoiw why as it eats up more power and you ca nt see clearly in bright sun  i like to use the viewfinder  it no longer has a tilt up feature so i end up mashing the battery into my cheek  this last complaint is about the batteries  sony lied about the amount of time that a battery will hold  the  hour battery only charges to  minutes on my camera  that s slightly more than  hours  it is nowhere near  hours  the  hour battery does not get anywhere near  hours either  their packages should be accurate  all in all  it is not as good as the older product  there also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec  button is not being pushed  this will be my last sony unless they make major improvements
__label__1 this album was by far the bands most daring ablum  they went away from the classic inxs sound that made them superstars  kick  x  and instead updated their sound to fit the time  like a previous reviewer noted  this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the us  and unfortunately  caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part  its sad too  cuz there are many solid tracks  inlcuding heaven sent  my favorite   not enough time  baby dont cry and beautiful girl  i have recently become a big fan of inxs and have purchased all of their albums  i like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums  i recommend  welcome  to any inxs fan and any other fan of great music
__label__1 i had to start version  without the user files from version  even without the user files version  more quickly adapts to my needs  i can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes  this reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document  for these reasons i m quite satisfied with the purchase
__label__0 first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage  besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire  he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point  that was of course before  s influence which brings us to our problem  the influence of curtis jackson aka  cent is very clear on this album  i like  but he knows little of the way we make records down south  if the gunit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks  verses etc everything may have been fine  the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the  a  is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable  this cd is garbage plain and simple and  s influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south s career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise s up  this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day onei have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he s dropped but  im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what s in your heart and get back to business
__label__0 i purchased this dvd and i was shocked to see the terrible violence and gore  especially on innocent animals  i would nt recommend this dvd to the faint of heart  especially to persons under  this was certainly a bad choice of purchase on my part
__label__1 mere words cannot express how pleased i am with my copy of  french verbs  very user friendly  well organized  a gem  i am currently working between learning spanish and french  between the two  i feel that french is the more difficult language  now  how to speak the language  the accent  sentence formation  idioms  for all the beauty of this reference book  no one comes even close to equaling behind the wheel french for teaching you how to put all these verbs together and actually speak the language like the natives  if you re just trying to get through a college french course requirement or never plan on really speaking the language  then  french verbs is perfectly fine all by its sweet self  however  if you do want to do more than read french literature and plan on hitting the streets in france someday  then by all means  combine this fabulous book with behind the wheel french cds  they also have a revised version for the same price that comes with a terrific book that is very instructional and easy to use   same price  with answers right on the same page  english translations  the whole nine yards  makes it very easy to learn french
__label__0 do nt bother buying  the wonder of girls  borrow it from a friend cause it will only make a turn around the office with many a snickeri could nt think of a girl i grew up with including myself who needed constant reassurance or had more trouble with math than boysi agree with the other review about we grow our own brains and make connectionsinfact  research shows if you give any child a chance at spatial tasks  the child improvesgirls often are given dolls   so how can a girl develope spatial ability playing with a doll  go fig  gurian does nt tell the reader anything about experience and environment  instead he is vocal about fixed brain function which of course leaves a child in a narrow subgroupgirls are all lumped into onei would nt let your daughter read this book   it might give her a bad case of low selfesteem and leave her wondering about herself as a womangurian wants women in second place at bestteach your daughter to believe in herself not some pop psychology from a questionable author bent on messing with her success
__label__0 i purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a frienda few hours later in ended up in the binvery dissapointing  bland and not to mention boring and derivative  some people from new york would understand what i mean   in summarynot only does kylie mingogue  i wont grace her name with capitals  fall flat on cdshe also cannot perform live and rely s on  gay camp it up  imagery to hide behind  a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit   a very bad performer and a shameful album

__label__0 i ve been using this shaver for almost a year  and am disappointed with it  for years  i ve used the older style remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism  i suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better  but i never got used to it  i find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because i feel like i ll drop it otherwise  the big problem is with the screen  try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen  otherwise  the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood  to clean  it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly  but getting it back on is tricky  if not very careful  it goes on unevenly and gets stuck  with practice  it usually works the first time  the funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall  it looks like a cuttingedge stateoftheart plug from the s
__label__1 maybe it s because i was upgrading from an older version      but i found the new features to be very good  for example  the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used  it was catching junk from the very beginning  and has missed very few things  i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email  also the security features are far superior to the  version  and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use  installation was seemless  i think it might be a little overpriced  but considering how long i will keep it  it s not too bad
__label__1 this ep is so good  that words cannot do it justice  they thought so too and exercised restraint  no lyrics  on this album  it is a departure from the previous album from the vapor of gasoline  which is also a very good album  in other ways  too  however  it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments  the production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and  thus  their interdependency  whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points  usually when things started to rock   ftvog also had the problem of being a bit monotonous  of course  in the end  you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings   all the suits began to fall off seems to be flawless  however  a wellrounded tour  very beautiful  bold and particular  try if you like  john fahey  tortoise  june of   sea tiger  etc
__label__1 today  i heard sister prejean speak about her book dead man walking and about all of the experiances that shes been through concerning the death penalty  nothing less than amazing  dead man walking calls upon the unjustices in the death penalty but also on the actual death penalty victims  many people think that death penalty victims are just plain bad people  read this book  if you want to be challenged on your views  read this book  you ca nt be idle on the death penalty  also  coming soon is the death of innocence  sister prejean spoke on the content of this book and the stories within it  once again  nothing less than amazing  a story that is priceless to hear and will influence your life

__label__0 my year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco  we put new batteries in that morning  the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset  when i tried to download the pictures to my computer  they were all gone  and the battery icon was flashing  based on what i ve read here  it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased  the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone   pretty poor  but good enough for my year to enjoy  but what good is that when there are nt even any pictures the next day  i m hoping the store will take it back
__label__0 i bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon  i had one of the original epiladies from the eighties  and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be painfree and effective  well  i guess you ca nt have both  it s very comfortable to use but completely ineffective  it takes forever to clear each section of hair  and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface  so the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job  i guess it s back to the good old razor for me
__label__1 i bought this razor over a year ago  and i would nt trade it in for any other razor out there  it really does leave your skin super smooth  i love the triple blades on it so i know i can get a close  comfortable shave  even in hard to reach places  thanks to the pivoting head  it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut  it s also excellent for shaving the underarm area  i find that one stroke is all it takes  and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe  this is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day  or more than three times a week  with this razor  it shaves so close to the hair follicle  you will be shaving in less time  less often  i will never part with my venus razor  the best part is  it s a bargain for what you get
__label__0 the movie title itself says a lot  the movie itself is a total scam  fools people to rent or to watch it  a horrible directing  script and performance  you d better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this braindean bad movie
__label__0 i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod  come to find out  this model does not have a fluid head  meaning  if you do any panning with a camcorder  it wo nt be as smooth as you d probably like it to be  also  at the end of a pan the head tends to  unwind   causing your panned image to back up a little ways  thus  i think it s rather misleading to label this as a  photo  video  tripod  additionally  i do nt really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters  finally  mine came with a few  very minor cosmetic blemishes  almost as if it were used  instead of video  i ll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount  if you want to do video  please buy a tripod with a fluid head  you ll love it  i guarantee that  that s why i give this one  stars
__label__0 i was quite disappointed by this book  i was expecting something with more professional level content  it s all very amateur however  the artwork used in the examples is subprofessional at best  i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific prepress issues relating to comics artwork  but the chapter there was frustratingly slight  you would be much better to buy a a more general prepress book  the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much
__label__0 i have been using norton antivirus since i purchased the compaq presario  the reason i have stuck with norton because this presario came with norton internet security  attached to it  i never used the nis   though  but i purchased the norton antivirus  nav   which i have bee using for the last three years  in fact i used the nav  for two straight years without any response from symantec  then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by symantec  i liked the nav   which symantec six months prior to its due date subscription  which made me mad and hence my wanting to try nis at a subsidized rate  because like nav   it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer  it is after purchasing and trying nis   that i realized how low and base norton can go with its software  first when i tried nis   it blocked all my websites  i couldnt access them and i could not read my email  whenever i tried to read my email  the response would be that  that action has been cancelled   so i reformatted my hard drive and the nis  appeared to be working quite well until i tred to install adobe reader  and could nt allow me to proceed  moreover  it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another  so i uninstalled nis  and installed nav   which appears to be working well  i have now purchased tend micro pccillin  as well as mcafee viruscan  at subsidized rates  should symantec pematurely terminate my nav  prematurely ie before the  days of subscription are over  i think one of the reasons why nis could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew  it tried to be an antivirus  personal firewall  privacy control  antispam as well as parental control in one  it reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from the radio  since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player  i think norton internet security is in that mode  it is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam  antispyware at the same time  hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program  at this stage  i would stay away from any program that calls itself  internet security   i may try trend micro internet security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users  but that will be if something goes wrong with my current nav  otherwise  i am still wary of those programs that pass off as  internet security  such as  norton internet security  or  trend micro internet security   pending their perfection of this technology at some future date
__label__1 i am from india  and megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following herefrom the few bootlegs of live shows that i did manage to get hold of  this seems to be one of the best gigs evermustaine s singing is as good as it gets live  if you think it is bad  then you havent heard him elsewhere  but such minor foibles aside  the gig is fin awesomethe setlist is almost perfectthe biggest pro is that most songs have been improvisedi love thati used to hate the fact that megadeth played cd perfect versions of their tracks  which was not funi d rather listen to the cd with better production and singingbut here  they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience  a stellar musical showjimmy de grasso  tho  he looks a bit nervous in my opinion  is unbelievaly tighthe looks like he is appearing for a test  when he s playing the solo on she wolf  you can see the tension on his face   but wotta solothe sticks alsmost blur outthe sound and picture quality is great toomy only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there s very lil bonus stuff on the cdsome soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rockedthey need to learn a thing or two from the  tallica guys about thisbut that apartbrilliant giga must for any metalhead
__label__1 unlike many of the other reviewers  i actually bought this shaver to use on my head  i have been shaving my head for the past  years and during that time have used a panasonic es it was a fine product  able to be used either wet or dry  unlike the braun   but i had no idea that upgrading to the braun  would make such a difference  i shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the panasonic  no longer did i need to keep going over the same spot again and again  the braun took off the hair in one or two passes  cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation  i ca nt believe i wasted two years shaving with my old shaver  i know panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers  and i ca nt comment on its new vortex shaver  but i know i wo nt be returning my new braun any time soon

__label__0 this is the classic original round stick old spice deodorant formula and now i realize that it is really dated  the formula has nt changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms  if you want the great smell of old spice then just use the after shave and cologne  but stay away from the old stick deodorant  i ll continue to use the old spice high endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas  scents and work much much better
__label__0 despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel  in fact with the exception of about  pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal  in the first few pages we re introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she s gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs  corrupt police  horribly bland and indistinguishable characters  and it just sucks from then on out  the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed  the characters however have no identity  they all sound the same  with the exception of the japanese characters  sadly the book lacks serious writing talent  very little character development  on what could ve been a good story  one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture  etc are really good  perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan  my advice  spend some time abroad again
__label__0 i bought two one time  but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both  they could not recorded vedio but audio only  it seemed that they had nt ccd at all  i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them  and the jvc even would not cover the charge
__label__1 i purchased this battery as a backup to the one that came with the camcorder  the great thing about this is  once charged  it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power  i discovered this last week when i wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but surprise surprise  its recharge time is very fast  the only negative part  if i must have to give  is  it s a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder  i say go for it

__label__0 i was very happy with the previous model dscn  which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting  but this one  while i only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather  it really disappointed me  the pictures are always blured due to too much exposure  i used auto flash  for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it is a point and shoot camera and it is mp  i m going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible i will return it  i just ca nt accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes  i doubt i was unlucky and got a bad one  i ca nt believe a mp sony camera takes so poor pictures  and after reading the previous review about the terrible sony custmer servce  i decide i will avoid sony customer service  and the camera will just be returned  note  found the review by cecelia choy  cece  on march    mentioned the same problem i had  i did nt have this problem with my previous model dscn april     i bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now  suggestion for those having the same problem i had before   exchange for another one

__label__0 the literature of september  is never attacked  when a book speaks of september   or of terrorism in general   it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism  it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy  jonathan safran foer s extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy  on such reverence  the narrative  which concerns a nineyearold boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock  unshell the enigma of his dead father  a narrative stolen  in its basic outline  from guenther grass s die blechtrommel   could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions  nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel  the others include hiroshima  nagasaki  the staten island ferry crash  and the dresden bombings  each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity  but historical  trauma  itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavementinspired creation  oskar  the insufferable brat  attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father  thomas schell  jr  a victim of september   by compiling an almanac of selfinflicted wounds  the collage of images and letters which is the book we are  reading   an almanac which  most likely  is written sometime in the indefinite future  thomas shell  sr s manuscript of      is heavily edited  pp     who has done the editing  almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar   if the term   reading  even applies  whenever a  pregnant  image is described  foer literally represents it in the form of a pictorial image  when a flock of birds rises into the sky  it is not enough that we read of these birds we must see them as well  words may not be left in their invisibility  we are presented with supplementary photographs  illustrations  since mere verbality is not enough   indeed  the entire novel oozes with misologos    the mistrust or hatred of language    in terms of both its content and its form   photographs  yes  and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages  space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes  for instance  typography does not substitute for a wellwrought sentence  foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities    most specifically  the responsibility to write well  why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal  as far as the writing is concerned  it is composed of nothing other than mindnumbingly  souldeadeningly repetitive phrases   heavy boots    raison detre   etc  and sunday school platitudes   sometimes one simply wants to disappear       there s nothing wrong with not understanding yourself       everything that s born has to die  which means our lives are like skyscrapers       how can you say i love you to someone you love   it s always necessary      whenever the author writes something that he finds  beautiful  and  true      he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is  beautiful  and  true   the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity  we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus a very deep truth indeed  one that foer also communicates in his essay   emptiness   originally published in playboy  with all of the sanctimoniousness and selfrighteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel  a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians  ringo star  and scientists  stephen hawking  are unthreateningly approachable  everything is familiarized  perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close  since the entire book is a vacuum  null space into which readers may project their own meanings  joseph suglia  phd   the author of watch out
__label__0 this film is a perfect example of how straight action and bigname stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama  i will not give away the plot   although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it  basically clooney s character mr ocean  a career burgler  is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino  so he recruits  men  each with a talent to add to the operation  this is where the trouble begins  the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters  there is almost no introduction to many of them  and barely even a mention of their names  literally half an hour into the film  the eleven  are assembled and they re already robbing the casino  how s that for plot development  and that s basically it ladies and gentlemen  go to vegas  rob casino  go home  movie over  some of the  good guys  are even outright repellant  our wouldbe heros  enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon  am i supposed to like this fat weasel  the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr ocean  is that the guy he s robbing  the casion owner  is a really bad guy  supposedly he has people killed  n stuff   this actor played a bad guy in godfather part    but we never see any real evil deeds  in fact  he just seems like a handsome  polite  very prosperous businessman  he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film  mr ocean on the other hand  and his cohorts  are career criminals  but the guy they re robbing is an even greater criminal  you see  so that makes it ok  and really  if you were being robbed  would nt you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt  they re such nice guys  that makes getting robbed fun  just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy  how thrilling  this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts  there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung  like a boxing match  which are essentially irrelevent  throughout there seems to be vital information missing  like say  a plot   soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts  this film is also horribly cut  several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced  and then completely forgotten about  take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino s owner makes an appearence  the folder he has just been handed  explains pitt  contains secret security codes  you would think that would be something important right  you would think they will need to get those codes  well  wrong  in fact you wo nt hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie  they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development  and that happens all the time in this movie  in fact mr ocean s team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties   and boy  they started repelling down that shaft quick  did nt they  you did nt even know they were robbing the place yet  wow  these guys are good  or maybe steven soderbergh is as overrated as his film   they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at eleven  this  after mr ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have  one would hope this film would at least end strong  but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed  we are left wondering whether the  eleven  actually got away with their caperor worse  what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being lighthearted  the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd   as did the actors in their commentary   probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending  i am loath to give either  or  stars  since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad  but this film comes very close to  star  this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product  it is big on budget  big on bling  and low on story  i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time  this is as good a way to do it as any  personally i would rather have a story with more substance
__label__0 i was expecting this book to be a great story  but very disappointed  i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is  the book is insipid and dull  has no flow  no story  or no plot  let me present an example  i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan  for example  sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way   if talk is getting cheaper  why did mci worldcom pay  billion to buy sprint  the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world  can regulators handle the complex new order   it has a clear logical axis  and has a force to attract readers into it  but jeter describes it like this   the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity  the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit   it always presents offcenter  trivial detail which makes a reader bored   of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact  like  the merger of company a  b raised the stock to x  etc there is no insight here  but unfortunately  unlike enron scandal  there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal  you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week  if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost

__label__0 i found this book vacuous and jejune  and frankly  i met the author  without knowing who he was  and he tried to pick me up  and i ve never heard such a pile of cr  in my life  and i m not even close to beautiful  so good luck with his advise
__label__1 without a doubt  the highlight is the dvd of the  show in london   born to run   the album  had put him on the cover of  time  and  newsweek  the same week in october    one of the very few times that has happened for a nonnews story  the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash   nobody can be that good   so here we see his first show ever in the uk  playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics  people thinking   hey   rock and roll future   this is the land of the beatles  the rolling stones  the who  who do you think you re kidding  no unknown kid from america deserves  time  and  newsweek    the show begins in almost total darkness  a piano softly plays  then harmonica  and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings  thunder road   accompanied by only piano  an unknown song at the time   thunder road  has become a springsteen classic  imho  especially given the expectations  it is a perfect understated opening  the dvd has the entire show  including everything from the hard rock of  she s the one   and  born to run   the song  to a much slowed down version of  for you   an underated sleeper on his first album   greeting from asbuty park  nj   bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear  this version of  for you  is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god  any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears  no taste  or was xenophobic  the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real  as a songwriter and performer  and that  born to run   especially  is an extraodinary album  there are only eight songs  but none are fill  repeated listenings of the four corners of the album  before cds   backstreets    jungleland   thunder road   and the title song are so good they become  well  addictive  works of genius  and lead to still more listening   tenth avenue freeze out    night   and especially  she s the one  could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album  even the whispered  meeting across the river   fits and helps the album become a coherent whole  the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts  as a footnote i ll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as  born to run  and that is his next one   darkness on the edge of town   everything he has released is good  a good bit of it is great  but i do nt think anything else matches  born to run  or  darkness   i do nt know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released  the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock s greatest performer  by  he would be the biggest rock star in the world  selling out multiple nights at football stadiums  the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears  perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement  the dvd   the making of  born to run    is interesting  but will probably appeal mainly to fans  however the dvd of the  london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce  or rock  roll  or showmanship  or history  its a treat
__label__0 i bought this cd after hearing tony on one of the am morning shows  and really likings some of his past offerings  but i have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money  i was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money s worth  tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years  and i expected a more mature offering from him than this latest  there is a great lack of maturity on this cd  and it s an overall disappointment  unfortunately  i have to say here that toney is not alone  what on earth possessed veteran soul singers the ojays to sing a song like let s ride  who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages  hoochie mommas  what  babyface  even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd  and what s up with the explicit lyrics  we all know you can curse like sailors  but why is this language necessary in music  and i know that artist have always performed their music  but will someone tell me why it s necessary to perform with so few clothes on  i would rather hear your music  not see your booty  sorry  but a review i just read triggered me  and i d been thinking about the tony terry cd for a while  hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time  meanwhile i think you re safe in skipping this particular cd
__label__1 i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas  and he is absolutely in love with them  the distance it can handle is slightly above average  but the clarity is really where this thing shines  its very easy to use  and has held up reasonably well  i would recomend it to the casual user

__label__0 it has been a couple years since i ve seen this  and i can still honestly say that it s like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking  a kind of swirly colorful mess  with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick  and ca nt escape it s yuck of a screenplayon a positive note  jim carrey is nt in it  other then that  nothing can redeem henry selick  kaja blackley  and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity  and i mean that from the bottm of my heart
__label__1 maybe i m just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together  but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product  to accomplish the reports that i need  i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose  so  it gets the report done  just not as nicely as i had hoped  tracking work is made incredibly simple  rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
__label__0 a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and ca nt cook and does nt have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about   she writes a very popular domestic advice column   she succeeds  until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut  enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby  problem is  she does nt have any of those things  she borrows the house  from a man who wants to marry her   she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house  and she even borrows a baby  the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy  and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it s really a girl  then the mother of the baby takes it back  and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one  then the woman is falling in love with the navy man  and he with her  while the man from whom she s borrowed the house still believes she s going to marry him  and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding  it s a delightful movie  very funny  and rich in both plot and character development  unfortunately  what probably makes it not a classic by today s standards  it is a bit plodding  it does not move at the same pace as  for example  the movie casablanca  with which it shares some of the same supporting actors
__label__0 a boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there  and they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk  they go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk  then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk  then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up  in other words  this movie is vintage decoteau  it defies all known logic  the boy shows up for his college interview  is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents   has lame effects and lots of half naked boys  it s hard to tell if this is a commentary on the catholic church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed  definitely another laugh riot from the director of such  classics  as leeches and leather jacket love story
__label__1 the story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with mitchum in one of his nastiest roles  it s almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in cape fear  he meets his match in lillian gish s character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is  sweet   in fact  the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film  charles laughton  in his only stint at directing  does an excellent job but i think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension  a very good example of film noir
__label__0 i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense  the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed  smooth fast transaction  five star

__label__1 this camera was a great investment  the photos turn out wonderfully  better than a regular film camera and i have kept an eye out on simular camerasprice wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price  the only problem i have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras have that problem  this is a great camera
__label__0 after doing extensive research on the web  i purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor  while the easy fit cuff was easy to place  the b  p readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous b  p cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor s office  since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings  i returned the b  p cuff to amazon for a refund
__label__1 richard fortney s  earth  is a survey  in mostly layman s terms  of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind  fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth  selecting a series of locations where the earth s geology is apparent  and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding  fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy  preceeds to the hawaiian islands  hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world  fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is  this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the  supercontinent  of gondwana  for each location  fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location  along the way  fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes  the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective  fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote  large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences  it turns out  for example  that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates  north america  ocean bottom  and northern europe   the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney s historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands  the narrative runs a little long at over  pages  and fortney s explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader  nevertheless  this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history
__label__1 the best rb band ever    i know some will disagree with me  but this is the band that really rock my boat  i mean  they were awesome and it was nt forced or fake  the rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down  i am in the process of getting all their cds  but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music

__label__0 i will keep this review simple  for the price this is an ok deal  however  the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop  the battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality batteries are generic rechargeables  you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger  batteries  it will wind up costing you less in the long run

__label__0 i was looking for a pair of roofprism binoculars like this  for hawk and bird watching  i had looked at swarovskis  but they were way out of my budget  nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution  these binoculars are crystalclear  with sharp focus  the mm lens lets in lots of light  lots more than the  s i ve been using  i wear glasses and the twist  up  and down eyecups are a blessing  there are also attached lens protectors for the mm  nice because i always used to lose them  for the price  these ca nt be beat
__label__1 published in   dr deming  out of the crisis  seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in american management mentality  two main subjects are discussed in the book  the first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations  the second  relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way american management operates   core points are suggested by dr deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods  throughout the book  dr deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the american industry  and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership  at times  the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow  but overall  dr deming s concepts are transferred to the reader  dr deming s  out of the crisis  helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one
__label__1 item received in perfect condition  checked with doctor  very good blood pressure monitor  thank you
__label__0 this is one of the worstwritten programming books i have seen yet  i m sorry i bought it  it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance  and dangerously little about c programming  duffy s review correctly describes the main flaws  i would add that    the book is not structured to build upon oo  gof patterns  or stl design principles     the code does not follow even basic c coding conventions     the images  screenshots  are agonizingly unreadable     the code listings are in italics using a variablepitch font is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a  book         no overarching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book  some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers  for example  pg  data types section           int  holds integer numbers up to a little over  million  for example   int i      long  same as int           wrong  professor  this is not only a syntactically incorrect example  but a just plain wrong assertion  if the reader does not know how to determine the  platformspecific  size of an  int  or  long   then the author has only served to confuse the matter further  furthermore  i consider it a  cheapskate  tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form  particularly when the book s code listings are so sloppy   that said  i would not use the code  even if it had been supplied for free  but it might have been interesting to have something to play around with  have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring  the only use i could see for this book is for intermediateadvanced fintechs  who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations  futures  forwards  etc   but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
__label__1 ummi do nt think you quite got the point of this album  it is not about the artists that you like  it is about the artists that inspired moore  your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh  i find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying  fck you soad  and so on  have some respect for other s opinions  unfortunately  you are a steriotypical  ignorant american  so with all that said  and with all due respect  i say  fck you pal
__label__0 if you are going to lay out  for a camera  you should expect a fair amount of camera  however  i have a few gripes here  first  there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough  all the nikons in the d series can use a wireless remote  you can buy an underwater case for those magnificent nikons so you can shoot underwater  you can get over  megapixels in a d  or d and you get that great nikkor lens  you do nt get much of a lens on the dc  and  megapixels do nt get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images  lets face it  this is an expensive pointnshoot camera for a tourist  not a serious camera  nuff said
__label__1 this book is a very detailed starting point for renaisance fans  at its heart this is a socioeconomic history  the clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant  chapter    the human unit  was the most informative  most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb  this is the type of book we all wished we had in school

__label__0 the island of lost maps  is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the  s  posing as a researcher  bland would enter rarebook collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a singleedged razor  then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting   or at least unquestioning   dealers  before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore  he had stolen more than a half million dollars  worth of maps   island  is the first book for author miles harvey  in the book  he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing page book  he is only partly successful  i found the material on bland s crime fascinating  however  bland as a subject does not fill the entire  pages because his life is dull  unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text  i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime  there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking  but as a true crime book  it over extends itself  it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused
__label__0 two main problems with this  cordless massager   the first being that it does nt hold a charge for very long  you may get an hour use on a full charge  and that shows diminishing power as it goes  add to that it s general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment  if you re looking for something to rumble a slight bit  this is for you  otherwise  save your money
__label__0 apparently the difference between a criminal act  theft  and moral redistribution of income is   who you steal from  stealing from the wealthy  of course  is moral   according to rawls and bolsheviks   and   who receives the loot  the nonwealthy makes it moral   and   who commits the act  the state  society  of course also makes theft moral  example  taxation   and   your intentions  redistribution of income   to look at this another way  if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money  that s a crime  unless your neighbor is poor   which would then be moral and justice  according to rawls  formula   if the community comes into your house and steals from you  it s legal and moral justice  again  according to rawls  because  according to rawls  if  before you were born  you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured  you d vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal  or they would be compensated somehow for being born  unjustly  lessequal  how  by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more  so those with more would be like oh  say  a milkcow who gets milked to serve those with less  so those with more would become a resource  or stateowned slaves to those with less  because  society   the robin hoods and rawls of the world  deemed this as moral justice  rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk  entrepreneurs  students of life who work to earn an  a  vs students who earn an  f   he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own  true  but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause  nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference  forcing the  wealthier  ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill is nt justice or moral  it would simply be an unjust law  some people see rawls  theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia  like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism   i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery  and a powerful disincentive for earning personal reward and merit  in a sense  this book is an argument against the individual  it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people   he does nt recognize any individuals  unless they were born as victims   curious  how do you experience life  as a groupmind  an oxymoron if there ever was one   a collective  or as a unique  isolated  independent  individual  there should be societal incentives to help each other  okay  but when it is forced  theft of property always implies force   it is no longer an issue of morality or justice   it s simply a law  without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue  by definition  transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom
__label__0 well  this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get  unfortunately  the female teenage protagonist  played by witherspoon  whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here  acts masculine and heroic  the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant  at one ridiculous point  the girl runs around acting like a commando  a veritable onegal army  blowing up the bad guys  while the boy hides in a cave sniveling  later  when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal s backpack as they cross a desert  the gal snaps at him  bella abzugstyle  and walks quickly ahead  leaving him in the dust  clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here  and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men  of course  in the real world  the result for such manly girls  once they become women  is that men do not choose them and they remain alone  and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men  of course  in this movie  the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy  masculine gal but that s why they call them movies  when are these postmodern writers  artists  and other cultureshapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism  they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females  men want someone to complement them  not compete with them  men crave femininity in females  not feminism  wow  is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment  this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie  at least his character does progress a little bit  by the end of the movie  instead of craven and flippant  he graduates to something akin to a metrosexualtype with a wildboy haircut  if that is even a step upward  but the plucky gal she s still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upsidedown gender relations  uh  another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert  something which should be  and for a time is here depicted as  a foreboding and lifethreatening task  yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog  and we see the boy s flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally outofplace manner  considering the dire situation they are in  the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these lighthearted  inane scenes  look  i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones  you know  old style disney movies  you take  old yeller  for example  now there was a quality kid movie  and quite true to life  this movie was not  it had a plastic  spoiledamericanmaterialisticteenybopper feel throughout  disney has gone down the tubes  in any number of ways  they ve been subverted by radical marxist agendas  note  one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called  tapping   while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their unpc judeochristian religion this is bias  folks  leftwing  pc bias  same as the aforementioned feminist bilge   i am learning to run  not walk  away from disney stuff  and this movie was further cause for me to do so

__label__0 i have been using turbotax since i started working fulltime after graduating form college  this year turbotax really drops the ball    i did nt have any espp transactions for a few years  tax year  i had some  and that was when i realized that nowadays they force you to use turbotax premier for espp calculations  the last time i had espp in  or so  the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate espp transactions with wizards  now you ca nt with deluxe version    for firsttime marriedfiledjoinly couples  they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filedsingle returns from  the deluxe version simply does not handle this at all  even if it helps you transfer the  returns  they do nt merge the data properly  for instance  if both couple have short  longterm capital loss carryovers from   the deluxe version does not do that for you  same for state  local taxes paid  refunded  worse  if even if you try to correct it  sometimes you cant  there is obvious bugs  and i have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms    nitpick  when you choose to print out the every forms  by default they print out all those only for federal taxes  i have to go to the state tab and choose my state  go back to the print menu  to print state tax forms  i am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year i use the mac version of turbotax  i use pc versions before   but i really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year  next year i may consider to switch

__label__1 this is an excellent film  a lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at hbcu s     as a matter of fact  the issue of lightskinned vs darkskinned is still going on today  on a college campus or not  spike lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time  he is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the african american community  i highly recommend this film  if you have nt seen it  get the dvd  it s a classic

__label__1 just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test  i was very pleased with the results  this is a powerful lens  yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use  i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds  zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera  canon eos d  and virtually every shot was a keeper  the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus  usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod  not so with this one  i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did nt see any problems with focus  clarity or sharpness  all the images were clean and razor sharp  if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment  i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal
__label__0 this is my first ludlum book and it is sure to be my last  the plot is preposterous because of ludlum s limited understanding of economics and history  once you realize that  all interest in the story falls away  it starts off plausible enoughand the blurbs on the jacket imply some  weapon  more powerful than a mere  million dollars  hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania  some spoiled  rich american brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history  i know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction  and it is all in good fun  but the plotconcept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest  if you do nt need logic in your fiction  it s interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story  but it falls far short in the historical  and economic  fiction department
__label__1 this is our favorite baby book for reading with our baby  young child  each of our children  from ages  months to three years  has loved this book  we buy this as a gift for all new babies
__label__1 i have been running windows xp sp and would  never  want to go back to windows me or windows  with the xp  i rarely need to reboot my system  and my pc no longer freezes up  there is a builtin windows firewall plus a popup blocker which are both awesome  the system is much safer  and i have never had a virus  worm  or trojan horse while running the windows xp home with a good internet security  virus program  one thing  make sure you have at least  mb of space available in your pc before starting to download  as this does require at least that  get it  you wo nt be disappointed

__label__0 i really dislike this software  i m the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way  first  when you initially select files and folders  your disk choices are  c   or  all   i have several disks and i want to pick and choose  but this program makes that really difficult  then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up  choose carefully  because you wo nt be allowed to change it later  and if you want to do incremental backups  be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save  because you ca nt do it later  basically the entire job  future backups and all  must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over
__label__1 the case with battery and filter is well worth thr price paid
__label__0 how can a bestselling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of  and turn it into a tedious snoozefest  one answer  write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases  another  strive to break the record for most clich  s in a single paragraph  finally  write about events in  as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences   thus  everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon  simon and the raccoons  simon on the failing american economy  simon attempting to reproduce american accents  this is a cd set for avoiding

__label__0 this product almost had me going to the er  i felt a little flush so i used this monitor to check my blood pressure  it was    a second check showed    i then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body  my wife an rn said calm down  breath deeply  i went over to my rottweiler and started hugging and petting her  after about  min  i felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed    i made a dr s appointment and brought the machine with me  in his office where my pressure always is elevated when he st takes it  i used the machine in front of him and my pressure was    i really got nervous  he took it with his machine and it was    you wo nt believe the relief  he took it again with another machine and it had come down to    i d like to return the machine for a nondigital one  i ve seen this before with a digital machine from a different company
__label__1 i really like omniform  actually i m using version  and i m very satisfied with it  i was using another forms program i had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good  after using formtool i have a much greater appreciation of omniform  scansoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs  tech support is expensive from scansoft and none of their software that i have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files  in contrast omniform was well worth the money  omniform  does a great job of either creating forms from scratch  scanning or converting from pdf  it s the only forms program i have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a pdf file  its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page  you can define any field with a variety of formats  example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified  you can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page  in the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size  you can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality  features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but i found omniform to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort  scanning in of a form is almost flawless  it even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them  other programs i have used could not do this well if at all  the only adjustments i had to make on scanned forms were sometimes omniform recognized text as bold when it was nt and occasionally it would change the font  for example it would change arial to times new roman on some spots of the form  strange quirk  to get a form imported from a pdf file you have to open the pdf file and print to omniform  this is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import  omniform really shines in this area  but i did notice if the form your importing from pdf has multiple pages omniform will give you an out of memory error when you try to save  to overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time  creating a new page each time in omniform to make a multi page form from pdf  a little time consuming when you have a  page form  it will create a self running exe form you can email and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back  this works even the other person does not have omniform on their machine  because some people filter out exe file attachments the program also creates a html version of the form  this is a very handy feature  the help file is not of much use  the paper manual is better but still lacking  if you have problems tech support from scansoft is expensive  but there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the scansoft web site  i have used the forum with great success  overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from pdf  but well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program i have used  i do recommend this program  if the flaws i mentioned were corrected i would give this program  stars
__label__0 i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series  this is by far the worse  i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like  but this work truly deserves a bad word  it is not about shakespeare  but rather about germaine greer  she simply did not do the assignment that she was given
__label__1 i discovered this software by accident  while window shopping  and i ended up buying it and taking it home  i was able to get it up and running pretty quickly  and was creating my own music right out of the box  of course it takes some time  but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time  add a mic to your computer  and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording  editing studio  make your own music and burn it to cd  sounic foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web  by providing an online community of acid musicmakers who review and comment on one anothers  work  you can also listen to music published by other users  even if you re just a musical legend in your own living room  this makes it easy and fun to become just that  sound forge also sells music loops on cd especially for acid  but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work  sound forge also provides weekly samples for free on their acid planet website
__label__0 this review covers the fbnr  same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an ir remote  somehow  i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered  nope  basically just builtin plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one s foot upon  that s fine  yet when i want to relax  i m not thinking about moving my feet  fortunately  those are removable  and removal is exactly what happened  the killer was that the center massage wheel  which is supposed to be powered and is supposed to spin  was doa this unit went back to the store  and we bought an fb instead  amazon has no listing for that model  so i ca nt give a full review on it  it was good enough to keep  both the fbnr and the fb share some traits  neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature  sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud  depending upon the operating mode chosen  i did db measurements on the fb  but since amazon does nt list that one  you do nt get to see them   the fb seems to have slightly better build quality  and everything worked out of the box  so we kept that one
__label__0 i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera  reviews here  price and functions  at the same time  i also purchased the larger xd card  almost out of the box  this camera has given me nothing but grief  what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo  a month or so after purchase  the lens would not open  or it would not open totally  i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the causeafter changing the batteries  the problems still existed  some of the time  not always  just sporadically  just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities  in addition to that  now that i m looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i m out the cost of that as well  another malfunction of this camera is after  erasing  all photos on the xd card  taking more photos and uploading the new photos  i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones  i do nt know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera  i would not recommend this camera to anyoneit s a total dud  i m very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons  good luck fujifulmyou need it

__label__0 i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them  i am very disappointed  the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky  it s constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste  it s very hard to clean  it s loud  and small brush  not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive  no thank you
__label__0 absolutely unwatchable  clicheridden  so silly it s very nearly offensive  it s like watching one long music video by a blevel rapper  full of dumb  beautiful women  buff  monkeyheaded ghetto thugs  and jokey trickedout cars  without a doubt one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  the script is laughable  the acting worse  vin diesel and paul walker are more  dumb and dumber  than  butch cassidy and the sundance kid   awful
__label__0 i bought this camera because i m going to jamaica and i needed a camera  the video camera was a bonus  when i first tested it  it was during the night time  however in a well lit room  but i could nt see anything  i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day  when i stepped outside  which was very bright and sunny  all i could see on the screen was white  i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen  the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day  i brought it back right away  thankfully i had bought it at walmart and they were happy to refund my money  i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera  i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option
__label__0 zoolook jeanmichel jarre is a case where the artist is way to avantgarde for his own best  after having made amazing albums such as oxygene  equinox and magnetic fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album  i find it a bit too much like modern art  ie  confusing  confounding and impossible to grasp  it also seems like jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album  he had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work  this is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avantgarde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album  very disapointing indeed
__label__0 far better models for similair price range  dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc works fine though
__label__0 this mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny  considering the comedic caliber of its two stars  billy crystal and robin williams  i was expecting a laugh riot  but that s not what this is  it s not their fault  it s the scriptwriters  i guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper  but that humor just did nt translate to the screen  despite the best efforts of mssrs crystal and williams  they deserve better  and so do we
__label__1 the title gets it right  this is a very fun album  there are a lot of great songs on here  infectious lyrics and music  it still surprises me that matthew sweet is nt more popular than he is  one other thingit s a sin that  we re the same  was nt a bigger hit than it was  truly a great song
__label__1 being a flight attendant myself and looking through the skymall magazine countless times on long flights i can tell youthis book is amazing  i have never laughed so hard from a book all my life  i really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge  i m sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it
__label__0 im going to rate this product a  because i like it but i would change a few things if i could  it does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff  the couple of things i would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord  you can play along with the program but its only about  seconds  then you have to stop and click play again  i wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again  the other thing is something a little more important  the product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play  its called olga  well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore  so you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the beetles or metalica or the grateful dead or anyone else  and thats what they advertise  play hit songs   so overall  knowing all this i would have shopped around more  especially for the price  its defenitly not worth  dollars when all you get is little  second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs
__label__0 image quality is pathetic  it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso     rest assured  you will be disappointed  i returned mine within a day
__label__1 i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past christmas  i am a physical therapist  and have over  years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction  i have tried out many cushions over the years  and from my experience  this product is as good as any higherpriced product of the same intent  the composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained  so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use  and the burgundy cover is removable and washable  it is also an excellent size for the averagesized person  my dad is approximately     lbs    it provides good sidebolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back  i highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products  most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives  like a massager  ribbing on the contours of the cushion  etc i ve found that simply maintaining good posture  not only in sitting  but all activity  allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life  again  i highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain  however  i must caution that commercial products are not a cureall to one s problems  it s always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms  but other steps are necessary in terms of fixing the problem  i highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist  as it is more than likely necessary that one would need  at least  proper education and intevention to help one to get better
__label__0 highly acclaimed  that  i knew  i watched the first  minutes  which is    of the movie  before i decided to hang it up  new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop  this upsets the local church  even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate  okay  can you really carry  hours with this single plot  nope  this one s boring
__label__0 they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was  the journey is awesome  then all of the sudden  the paid wwe guys just began to badmouth the warrior  maybe he did have questionable judgment  but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved  they take some very low blows  they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler  actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young  and i really ca nt distinguish one s ability from the other  they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations  vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for  years was because he failed a drug test  as soon as he says this  they fade to black then come back with a new issue  what drug use  which drugs  presumably they re talking about steroids  but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use  let s not talk about that  let s just keep ganging up on the warrior  they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior  and they also just try to badmouth him so much  who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him  i do nt  he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk  and oh yeah  they do nt even let the warrior defend himself  why did i have to find out from imdbcom that he was asked to appear but declined  why do nt they address this  this  docu  is more slanted than  fahrenheitt   every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it  it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth  tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking

__label__1 sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre  it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting  its not what you would really consider to be a  religious  album but there are many undertones that help get the message across  this point being made very clear in  museum of iscariot  which talks of jesus from judas  point of view  rowan s vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album  from low opera type to screaming  in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old  if you are into relaxed darkwave  goth music this is a perfect album to purchase
__label__0 if you have this book  keep using it for the review only  but not for the tests  i suggest  use  tests of meylani for the practice

__label__1 this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans  romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it  the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures  it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work  but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either
