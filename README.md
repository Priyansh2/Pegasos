# Pegasos
Implemented Pegasos (Modified SVM) from scratch in Python. 

* Different Kernel Support: ```Linear, Guassian, Polynomial```. 
* Support for K-fold cross validation.
* Performance comparison is made with Scikit-Learn implmentation of SVM for all three Kernels on supervised learning task with feature extracted using TF-IDF scores and fastText library.
